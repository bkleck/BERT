The apartment is just a quick walk away from a great downtown area with some really cute shops, cafes, and restaurants.  Paula made us feel at home in her space!  She made restaurant recommendations, and was very helpful in providing directions to/from all locations I asked about. 

As this was my first time to Seattle, I was unaware of how many hills are in this city!  Queen Anne is located at the top of a big hill which overlooks the city.  There are a lot of spectacular views of the mountains, the cityscape, and Lake Union, which is a great perk when you are a tourist.  However, being on top of a big hill does make walking back to the apartment after a long day of sight-seeing daunting, so taking the bus was necessary.  Thankfully there are bus stops super close the apartment.  Walking to the downtown area or tourist attractions was about a 30 min walk, mostly downhill.  Overall, I loved staying in a quiet neighborhood that provided a different view of the city.",Overall I loved staying in a quiet neighborhood that provided a different view of the city,1

It really felt very full-service and communication was always quick and helpful. The apartment was exactly as described neat, clean, and stocked with everything we needed and more. My husband and I slept on the pull-out couch while our toddler took the master (I know, I know...). But it was definitely the most comfortable pull-out I have ever slept on, maybe even more comfortable than the 'real' bed! There was a nice welcome basket when we arrived which we took advantage of, and also enjoyed eating dinner on the lovely roofdeck. A wonderful first trip to Seattle.

The photos are representative (with the exception of the two with the orange wall, which must be another property?), but the couch and shower curtain have been updated.  It was wonderful to have a full kitchen, and washer and dryer.  We did not have any trouble with entry/exit instructions, as David made it all clear.  The parking space was tight, but that is pretty standard at these sorts of complexes.  While there was a bit of road noise from the street directly out front, it did not bother us.  We're from a big city and are used to some noise, so neither of us used the earplugs that were provided for guests.  We loved being so near to the Myrtle Edwards State Park, which has  a lovely trail along the water for running/walking/cycling.  When the weather was nice, we walked to Pike's Place Market, to the Seattle Center, and to restaurants and bakeries in the neighborhood.  We definitely plan to stay here again, next time we visit Seattle, and we'll recommend it to our friends.  ",It was wonderful to have a full kitchen and washer and dryer,1

The sheets and pillow cases appeared to have not been changed since a previous person slept in the bed. There was no top sheet, just a single comforter. Fortunately, we brought our own pillows.

The way the double bed is situated is awkward. One side is against a large headboard, forcing the inside person to clamber over the outside person should he/she need to get out of bed in the middle of the night. Because of this, the room is best suited for a single person.

Finally, we felt the bath room had not been cleaned, and the liquid soap was extremely watery.",Fortunately we brought our own pillows,-1

The neighborhood was quiet and easy to find parking just outside the house. There are restaurants and cafes nearby as well.  

The home decor is artistic and absolutely beautiful. Sabrina was very thoughtful that she put notes everywhere in the house to give us kind reminders.

Walking distance to the house are a plethora of restaurants, coffeehouses, shops, etc.  Very safe area.  Make sure you walk to Molly Milk ice cream to try their various flavors.  Its under 15 min drive to downtown where all the ""touristy"" spots are.  Walking distance to Fremont neighborhood which has a hip and eclectic vibe to it.  The house itself was exactly as described in the pictures.  What made this so great was Tobin's attention to detail in preparing the apartment for guests.  He has a book which lays out everything you would want to know about the stay, wifi issues, nearby things, etc.  A wonderful guide!  The beddings, bathroom, furnishings, and everything was clean and tastefully decorated (down to the small details like door knobs and bathtub tile).  Due to its separate entrance, you have your utmost security and privacy.  A nice washer and dryer were present as well, along with coffee, electric tea pot, etc.  Very well supplied in terms of amenities and accessories.  I should add that you will hear steps occasionally of people walking upstairs, and a little bit of the backyard chickens in the morning, but it was nothing significant or bothersome.

Setting: the neighborhood is filled with single family homes were noise is not an issue at all. Fit & Finishes: the materials used inside the in-law apartment and around the home would easily land this place inside of a custom home magazine. Landscaping: you can tell a lot of thought went into were each plant was situation throughout the property and how well they are managed. Location: a minute drive from the 99 which was always void of traffic which takes you right into down town Seattle, and about a 3 minute walk to Queen Anne's shops and restaurant but I wouldn't have noticed this hidden fact if not for Patrick letting me know.

My host was very helpful in helping me plan my trip and was available for any questions if need be.   It was a very nice retreat in a safe neighborhood and I hope to return next year.

I called Tony the day we arrived in town to make arrangements to meet him at the condo. He responded to all enquiries promptly and met us at the agreed upon time. The apartment was great and the view was as advertised. I think the photos I took are even better than what is shown on the site. It's about 10 min walking distance to Pike Place Market. I also liked that a parking stall came with the rental. Saved a lot of hassle trying to park downtown.

The apartment was really clean and comfortable. We (my girlfriend and I) didn't spend much time there, but it was in great shape with extra clean towels and sheets.

We took off one star because communication leading up to our trip was difficult. Carlos didn't respond to email or text messages the day before, or the day of the trip, and we hadn't received any check-in instructions. This left us wondering if we had a place to stay as we headed to the airport in Tucson. As we were getting on the plane my phone buzzed with a AirBnb message from Carlos with the check-in instructions. Everything worked out fine, but the lack of response over those two days left us with a lot of anxiety.

After that everything was great. Getting into the apartment was easy and Carlos was very responsive once we were there. Check-out was also a breeze. Now that we know the drill, we would definitely stay here again.",We took off one star because communication leading up to our trip was difficult,-1

The Host: Seattle's Unique Downtown Loft was the perfect place for us to stay. As soon as we arrived, our host treated us like family. She made sure we had everything we needed to enjoy our time in the loft. She gave us tips and suggestions on restaurants, neighborhoods, bars, and local festivals. In case you forget, she leaves you with a binder full of local information and restaurant delivery menus. She even drove us to the store to pick up snacks and beer! We could have walked, but thats just not their style at this place. They really make sure you are taken care of! They are also attentive to any needs you might have during your stay. 

The Loft: This place was perfect and exactly as advertised. We arrived to clean, well appointed, and definitely unique accommodations. We had a blast shooting pool and playing darts while we watched sports on the big screen HD TV. It was the perfect place to spend time with friends and family in-between going out to see everything Seattle has to offer. The chalkboard walls in the bathroom were a great touch and we left our share of graffiti all over them.

The Location: The Downtown Seattle location was perfect for us. Our main goal was to attend a couple of Seattle Mariners games, which we did, by simply walking about 50 yards from the Loft to the gates of SafeCo Field. It was awesome. It was also walking distance to Pike Place Market, the Space Needle, and a ton of bars and restaurants. When we didn't feel like walking, we never waited more than 5 minutes for an Über to swing by and scoop us up. 

The Wrap-Up: Seattle is an amazing city and this Downtown Loft is the best. 10/10 would stay again and again and again. Honestly, we didn't want to leave. 

Perfect For: Baseball games, Football games, Sightseeing, Family Reunions, Bachelor/Bachelorette Parties.

Thank you so much from all of us. We really had an amazing weekend and couldn't have asked for anything more, although if we did, I'm sure you would have accommodated!

57567,1494828,19263087,2014-09-09,5603975,Corri,"This is the second time staying in a ""William""  accomodation.  I won't stay anywhere else when in Seattle.  I found my home away from home.  The accomodations are second to none and his hospitality surpasses everyone's expectations.  My son is now a part of Seattle because of his years at UW....andI now travel from the East and know I am home too especially staying at such a special apartment.

The apartment and location are phenominal.  Eastlake is the place to be adjacent to the UDistrict and to the City.  We have made it a tradition already to eat at 14 Carrot and Louisa's for breakfast and have dinner on the Lake at EastLake Grill.  We have made friends while walking along the water seeing the houseboats and bumping into neighbors with dogs and/or gardens.  

Whether staying in the 1 bedroom downstairs or this 2 bedroom the decor and amenities abound.  The apartments lack of nothing from shampoo to pot holders to 3d TV!  From the apartment everything is central yet not overwhelming like the UDistrict.  1.5 miles seems like a world away.

We ate out alot but were able to make a full 4 course meal with what William provides in the kitchen.  We also rented a movie and were completely comfortable snuggling up in the LR.  As a testiment to our happiness, my mom (70 years old) felt so at home she took a bubble bath every night in the tub, learned to love the innovation of the washer/dryer-in-one technology, and embraced what IKEA has to offer.  She didn't believe that William would supply the basics so she doubled up on toiletries and brought her hair dryer.  She even doubted the number of hangers in the closet as she always needed more before and he couldn't have a respectable iron for her pants.  Again she was wrong.....I loved saying ""I told you so"" because the closets had lots of hangers and a proper iron.  She is a William and Airbnb convert! 

I hesitate to share my secret hideaway and my home away from home as it has become but have to always rave about William's apartments and his personal touch.  I am so lucky to have made Seattle my second home because of my son but really its my second home because of William.

 The kitchen is great equipped, you definetely will find everything to cook your own dinner. The cottage was equipped with fresh soap, shampoo, conditioner, towels, hairdryer and even all the basic spices and some tea.
Annie always answer the emails right away and she really tries to make your stay as comfortable as possible. She even  asked us ahead of time if she should buy some groceries for our fridge for our arrival. 
The surrounding of upper Queen Anne is absolutely georgous. It is nice to walk around and you will have some great views of the bay up there. The busline for downtown is leaving just in front of Annies house and you may choose between two lines. If you got a car you can park safely direct in front of the cottage. 
In the cottage you will find a lot of information about Seattle (as well as the schedule of the buslines and ferries) and of course of the nice surrounding like Mt. Rainier and so on. If you got further questions about some trips Annie will gladly help you. 
Annie does have one dog and two cats but they are not allowed to come into the cottage, in case you are allergic. 
On the other hand Annie and her family always respect your privacy and do not come into your cottage unless you like it.

The apartment has no surprises. The pictures are exactly what you will find. The entrance is private, attached near the main home. We felt safe and at home. The kitchenette is perfect but sadly we were out and about so often we only used the area once for cooking.  There are coffee pots, microwave, regular size fridge, lots of extras in the cabinet (coffee, tea, and some household ingredients. {oil, seasonings, etc} ).  We were a 1.3 mile walk to a local Catholic church, and great cafe's.  If you get a chance visit Columbia City Bakery for a delicious pastry and superb coffee. Our walk was along a busy street but we felt safe the entire distance.  Lots of bus stops along the way and also the Lite Rail is a short distance from the apartment. The weather for us was a treat. We did have a bit of rain the first two mornings but otherwise the temps were 70-80's and sunny. The drive to downtown Seattle is quick (15 miles ). Our daughter took us around to see the sights. A must for all travelers is a visit to Pike Market. We visited a Farmer's Market in Magnolia, rode the Ferris Wheel, drove 2 hours south to visit Mnt. Rainier, and many other adventures too numerous to list. We were first time customers of AirBnB and will do it again and again.

Due to our groups busy schedule we never had the chance to meet Greg, but he took steps to ensure that we had everything we needed and so we were not reliant on making our schedules match up.  He made sure to give us all his contact info in case we needed anything or had questions, along with a great breakdown of where everything was in the place.  He went so far as to leave town maps, food suggestions, info on which buses to take to downtown (which took maybe 10 minutes to get to), a helpful app that made using the transit a breeze, even access to his Netflix account via the Roku!

Essentially I'm saying that if you need a place to stay in Seattle, Greg's place should be at the top of your list.  Each person in the party I was with said that they would stay there again no questions asked!  We all look forward to having another chance to visit Seattle and stay with Greg!

I am from NY and my stay in Seattle was for 10 days, I was on my own and I was looking for a place to feel safe and comfortable in.  What I found exceeded my expectations.  The cottage is, as is Nan, very welcoming.   It is compact, and yet, it had everything I needed; a super comfy bed, a well equipped kitchen, very clean, and cheerful.   As an artist I really appreciate Nan's attention to detail and placement.  Every bit of my experience there was a delight and it suited my needs perfectly.   Nan is a super lady, very interesting and was extremely helpful and accommodating. She placed me in the right direction when I needed help navigating .  I could go on and on in praise about all the little touches...but you need to see it yourself!  This Charming Garden Cottage is truly Charming.

Upon arrival at the home we were amazed at the well manicured landscape. The pictures are only a small representation of how nice the home is. Joe answered the front door and directed me to the private side entrance. We had a brief conversation with Joe and he was very welcoming and warm.  He also told us about all of the goodies near and inside the mini fridge.  There is also a hot/cold water cooler located in the room.

The space is open and expansive and equipped with everything that you could ever need or want to use. The bed is comfy as is the air mattress.  With the sliding room dividers you can easily divide the space into two rooms at night for added privacy.  The decor is nice and I especially appreciated the open light due to multiple windows throughout.  The amenities were above and beyond our expectations. This space is truly a bargain for what you get.  There are several bus stops within a 5-10 minute walk for easy access to downtown and other areas in Seattle.

The following day we had the privilege of chatting with both Joe and Shannon and they were warm, cordial, and welcoming. They repeatedly told us that if we needed anything at all to contact them.  

Overall this was an amazing experience and they have set the bar high.  By far one of my favorite Airbnb experiences.

They work downtown and were able to pick me up and drop me off at the light rail station which I took to/from the airport. They are very friendly and knowledgeable about Seattle. Stan will bend your ear with a poetic narrative of dozens of stories from a life well-lived. Carrie brews a mean cup of cowboy coffee! And Rocky, the Australian Healer, will give you all the love you can handle. Mind the gray dog hair (but he sleeps topside). The accommodations are what you'd expect from an aging sailboat - tight quarters, no TV and a toilet for #1 only. Hot showers and bathroom are right onshore. While Stan and Carrie would make any stay enjoyable (and they're right on the boat with you), the big bonus here is the VIEW! Amazing sunsets featuring rows of sailboats with the Puget Sound and Olympic Mountains forming the backdrop. The beach at Golden Gardens Park is a short walk. Plan your transportation if you don't want to rely on Stan chauffeuring you around. I believe there is a bus stop nearby (I didn't use it) and I also believe you could park your car or motorcycle at the marina. I rented a bike from Dutch Bicycle a few miles away.

This is coming from another Airbnb host. In fact, I'm a Superhost, so I know what it takes to earn the coveted designation and the excellence that is required to maintain it. Kelly was there to meet me when I arrived in the evening. As I was reaching for the doorbell, I could still see her through the glass on the door making sure everything was perfect and set up just right. It was a rather cold  evening in Seattle so after walking from the train stop in downtown, I was freezing. Her place was warm and toasty and in the perfect welcoming condition for someone who was freezing with numb hands. Her place was as immaculately tidy as can be and utterly spotless. It was comfortable and super quaint and spacious too. The décor made it feel like home. The shower was hot and the bed was as comfy as my own bed, if not more! I didn't use the kitchen at all, but I saw that it was well equipped with everything you would need if you did any cooking. Kelly's place was in a quiet neighborhood. Before I booked, I thought I wanted to be more in a bustling area, but after staying in Kelly's place, I realized it was in the most ideal location. The noise level was immediately appreciated as there was none of it, so I slept like a baby. Quiet in the beautiful neighborhood of Queen Anne with its unique architecture and craftsman style homes, it was exactly how Kelly described it to be - only a short walk to the Space Needle and Chihuly museum and about a 20 minute walk to downtown. Once you're downtown, then pretty much everything else in Seattle is right around it. Kelly took her time explaining everything to me about her home and what to see and do in Seattle and how to get around. I was flabbergasted at how keen Kelly was to every detail. Kelly even managed to squeeze in a little time to play tour guide with me, but don't expect that all the time as she's such a busy bee! Kelly is the essence of all things a wonderful host is. She certainty sets the bar very high and I thank her very much. I can't recommend any more to stay at her place while in Seattle, it's the perfect place, and you'll have no regrets.

It was shared between a friend and I, and it was private, quiet, and a nice resting spot to come home to after sightseeing all day.  The apartment made me feel like a local, and the neighborhood was lovely.

It was close to public transportation and very easy to navigate to and from downtown and other neighborhoods.  Maija was easy to get into contact with and a pleasant person to deal with.

Photos and description were accurate.
Neighborhood was great and close to U Village and walking distance to the football stadium and other parts of campus.
Fruit, homemade granola, coffee and a great selection of tea were provided.  Washer and dryer were very handy (especially with our toddler granddaughter.
We had a minor issue with the new water heater, Sarah was very responsive and even offered to come over on Thanksgiving morning to have her and Andrew check it out.  I was able to figure out the problem and all worked fine.

8847,723723,29918890,2015-04-14,20123606,Amalia,"When we arrived, Rachelle greeted us and gave us a tour. The Bungalow was family-friendly and mostly child-proofed for our 1-and-a-half-year-old daughter. There were plenty of toys and board books in the Bungalow, in addition to a pack-and-play crib, potty, a hook-on dining seat, and children’s utensils and dishware in the kitchen.

Our hosts lent us a small yard waste bin to keep in the front yard outside the bungalow, which made it more convenient to empty our compost bin. Upon arrival, we requested a safe place to keep, or lock-up, our bikes. In response, our hosts installed secured hooks which we were able to lock our bikes to :).

As mentioned in the listing, the Bungalow has low ceilings (approximately 7 ft). I think I passed over this detail when reading the listing originally. My husband is 6’7” and could not stand up fully in the shower/bathtub, but overall, he didn’t mind the ceiling height. The listing photos show the furniture in the living room and office in an arrangement which was different than during our stay. We were happy with the layout though. The microwave stopped working during our visit. Rachelle brought us an electric, stainless steel kettle for boiling water, which is what we primarily had used the microwave for. To me, the Bungalow seemed darker inside than it looks in the photos.

The listing mentioned that the WiFi is not super speed, which is true—it’s pretty slow and unreliable at times. Several times during our 1-and-a-half-month stay we could not browse the internet on our desktop, because the WiFi signal was weak (our desktop was set-up on the desk in the office/futon room, which is at the back of the house). The WiFi signal was strongest in the bedroom (at the front of the house), which was inconvenient.


The neighborhood was relatively family-friendly. From the Bungalow it was an easy walk to the #2 bus stop, a duck pond, the library, a couple playgrounds and play areas, and Madrona’s shops. A little further away, but walkable if you have the time and energy, are the arboretum, and in the other direction Leschi (where there is a small but well-stocked grocery store).

The home is 3 levels and is furnished beautifully, including the Bosch washer/dryer which came in handy after my week-long cruise to Alaska. The plug and play adapter cords also came in handy in broadcasting videos and photos from my phone to the big screen TV. Although there is no A/C, there are fans and cross breezes to help cool the entire home down. 

I loved the proximity to the local restaurants, bars and coffee shops. However, it is quite a trek to walk to downtown. With my two young sons, I just used Uber which cost between $7 - $10.

I would stay here again without hesitation.

He had the apartment cleaned, stocked and ready to go so once we got there we didn't have any issues.  It was a little warm the day we got there so he already had the portable air-conditioner running and it made the room very nice. He was helpful in showing us a map and talking options for dinner.

Great location right in between the Space Needle and Pike's Market, so everything is within walking distance.  A glass-blowing studio (where you can do it yourself) is just out the back door.  Neat!  We were also just a short bus ride away from the stadiums ($2.75 per person peak hours) so we could catch a pre-season football game.

Apartment had good internet access, cable TV and Netflix.

There is parking out front for 2 hours at a time.  It'll get pricey, so plan on parking in a lot.  We chose the Securities building (Macy's is in the same building) parking garage about 4 blocks away at $27 per 24 hours.  It was well lit and easy to get into and out of.  There are a couple cheaper options, but be aware that you might have to plug a meter twice a day.  We just parked our car, picked it up three days later, and paid on the way out with a credit card.

The only downside with the apartment is that I would prefer a slightly better mattress.  It's not bad by any means, but I'd put it in the OK/average range.  My wife and I have a latex mattress at home and there's nothing better than to wake up after sleeping on a good mattress.  No matter where you stay, the mattress is always a craps shoot, so you could say that this one ain't all that bad.

My wife is very picky about where we stay and she was very pleased with this choice.  She certainly has no hesitations about coming back.  It is certainly on our short list for when we come back...I might not even try anywhere else.  It's a great location and will save you some $ over the hotels.",I might not even try anywhere else,1

It is very spatious and well equipped and in a charming neighborhood. On a clear day, you can even see the beautiful Olympic mountains from the bedroom windows. The fact that you share the entrance to her house did not seem an issue at all.
Unfortunately, the communication with Donna on the day of our arrival was not as smooth as could have been, but presumably this was a one-time exception as she seems to be a reliable and kind person. And the compensation she offered was more than fair.

Location: Perfect! The location is a quick drive away from the downtown area (~15 minutes). There was plenty of parking in front of the complex.

Housing: There were two bedrooms, both equipped with queen size beds that were super comfortable. There was also a pull out bed in the living room (that was somewhat comfortable). The overall living quarters were well decorated, warm and welcoming (we were greeted by a faux fireplace display courtesy of netflix). B&N provided everything down to the tiniest of details-- extra toiletries, towels, linens, blankets and pillows, chocolate, coffee, and even umbrellas for the rainy season! B&N also provided a guide to city in a neat little folder filled with many maps and recommendations.

Communication: B&N were easy to contact via the airbnb app or via text. They were prompt and very helpful. They were always willing to help make our stay more enjoyable and exciting.

Value: I would definitely recommend this location to my friends. I would also definitely rent from them again in the future (perhaps during the non-rainy season).

Overall: A++++ would rent again!",Value I would definitely recommend this location to my friends,1

Pikes place is a few blocks down and very walkable.  This apartment was exactly as shown in pics.  It's beautiful and you can tell that they are no stranger to hosting guests.  The complimentary waters, coffee, plenty of extra toilet paper, and paper towels, the robes; everything was well thought out to make us feel at home.  Everything was labeled so it was easy to find things.  It was great that there was cable for us to watch tv at night.. and they have 1 in each room!  Another plus, AC in the living room!!

I feel so terrible.  I had no idea from the listing ""Plush Modern Hilltop Retreat"" that this basement apartment was actually in a dangerous neighborhood and that I may have been putting my family in danger by staying there.

There might have been mold in the dark apartment which caused me to experience some serious asthmatic wheezing. We needed to air out the musty smell from the apartment.

Tragically . . . we were asleep and didn't get the message Jyoti sent us @ 11:13pm the night before we left @ 5:30am. The information ""be sure to lock all windows and doors when you leave including the front door,""  contained in the final sentence of a 6 paragraph e-mail wasn't read by me until it was too late. 

Of course it was very, very irresponsible of us not to read the rules and in the 15 communications FROM Jyoti (2 in person) we should have asked her about the danger and crime in Seattle generally and in her neighborhood specifically and we should have wondered (having lived in actual dangerous neighborhoods in London and NYC and Brooklyn and Washington DC and LA for many many years) why there aren't bars or alarms on all the windows and doors of the apartment.  

If only we had . . . if only, as Jyoti wrote, we hadn't  ""dropped the ball on observance of house rules,"" and created a ""major trust and security breach.""

I'm very sorry about all that indeed and boy have we learned our lesson about the new definition of the term ""security breach.""

I was originally going to write, ""Recently remodeled, nice apartment, close to transportation . . . perfect for our lovely trip to Seattle.  The apartment had everything we could want and more.  Jyoti was lovely and friendly and very helpful."" But I guess all that is meaningless now that we've violated the house rules.

9708,888967,5789409,2013-07-16,4005050,Kevin,"(I stayed at Eric and Alex's Zero-Energy House for two days and then a day later, for another two days. To help better visualize: I stayed there, Wednesday and Thursday, then found a place to stay in Capitol Hill for Friday, and then returned to the Zero-Energy House for Saturday and Sunday and checked out Monday. So I posted two reviews of Eric and Alex's Zero-Energy House because technically I stayed there on two separate occasions however, for all intents and purposes, my stay on Wednesday and Thursday did not deviate in quality (SUPER HIGH QUALITY might I add) from my stay on Saturday and Sunday; therefore I wrote the same review (see below) for both of my stays just because it felt like one singular experience. Just wanted to post a clarification just in case this review appears twice under the reviews for Eric and Alex's Zero-Energy House. Anyway, the short version is the Zero-Energy House is the best place I've stayed in via AirBnB.).

Staying at Eric and Alex's Zero-Energy House was a tremendous experience. The house itself is beautiful. The photographs do in fact do the house a certain amount of justice but nothing quite compares to actually being in the house. There was a tremendous amount of thought and design acuity put into the making of the house and it was just a pleasure to stay in it. Not to mention, it was supremely clean and just felt incredibly new overall. So it seems obvious that my girlfriend and I were quite satisfied with the bedroom in which we stayed. Lots of closet space and drawer space, and lots of space in general. The windows afforded a nice cool breeze at all times and real nice sheets of fresh natural lighting. And again, supremely clean. The location is tremendous as well. The neighborhood itself is quiet and safe. I didn't rent a car so I didn't really pay attention to whether or not there were any parking restrictions but I really cannot imagine there being much difficulty in finding parking. As for the house's proximity to things to do; my girlfriend was vending at a art/crafts show at Seattle Center and there was a bus stop two blocks away from the house where we picked up a bus that took us to Seattle Center in less than 15 minutes (and once you get to Seattle Center, you can walk, bike, or catch another bus quite easily to other parts of the city like Belltown, Pikes Place Market, the sports venues, South Lake Union, Capitol Hill, etc.). Not to mention, for eating and dining, there are just loads of restaurants and bars within completely reasonable walking distance from the house (5-10 min walks). And finally, coordinating the check-in and check-out with Eric was simple and effortless. Even though we didn't cross paths too frequently, I have no reservations in saying that Eric and Alex are nice, personable people and tremendous AirBnB hosts without a doubt.",The location is tremendous as well,1

The house is tucked away at the end of a quiet little street in the middle of a very nice area of the city. Capitol Hill and Downtown are both very accessible from the bus routes near the house. There are three stops (that I used) within about a half mile from the house, and they're all a pretty easy walk. The buses usually run every 15 minutes until it gets late - then they switch to every 30 minutes. You can walk to Capitol Hill as well, but the walk there is up a pretty steep long hill. 

Check out the Central Co-op (about a mile and a quarter away - bus or walk) for healthy food and local produce. Just around the corner from the co-op is Seattle Yoga Arts, which offers a new student 3 classes for $30 special - pretty good if you're in town only a short time.

The room itself is very comfortable. The space heaters keep the place as toasty as you want it and the bed is super cozy. And the book selection is ridiculous! From obscure music to Eastern philosophy, yoga, math (and being a mathematician), classic novels and how-to manuals - they've got so interesting many books! And the decor is equally as interesting - lots of really cool and quirky art. 

I couldn't tell from the pictures, but the bathroom is attached - so it's all yours and you don't have to leave the room to get to it. That goes a long way in making it feel like you've got your own space. 

But if you have the chance to get to know the hosts and their sweet pups, you totally should!

Harriet's place was clean, neat, well-appointed, and the bed was very comfortable.  The views from our private deck were just as pictured and it was wonderful having coffee overlooking the Sound.

On our first night, Harriet directed us to a variety of restaurants just a few minutes from her home; on the way, the views of the Sound were breathtaking, and the restaurant we went to (Cactus) had great Tex-Mex cuisine.  The sunset view from there was spectacular.

We loved being out of the hustle and bustle of the city and the water taxi taking us from West Seattle to Seattle was close and convenient.  On our ride home in the dark, we were treated to a lightening show above the city.

It was nice to have so much room, and we also enjoyed the chairs and table on the front lawn on one sunny afternoon.

Even though it looks like this is far from the downtown, the connection is very convenient: bus stop is two blocks away, bus ran every 10 minutes and was near the Pike Place in about 10-15 minutes.  Buses have a special lane on the Seattle Bridge, so they can often get to downtown faster than a car.  We have friends of a friend who live in West Seattle and they use the bus every day.

West Seattle is a cool destination itself.  The beaches are nice and full of people, views of Seattle from the east side are spectacular, and there is an abundance of bars and restaurants to choose from--especially along the Alki beach and California Avenue.

One last thing: read carefully the house rules/manual.  Even though you pay a cleaning fee, the guests are supposed to clean after themselves, including washing the towels and linens. The cleaning fee is refunded afterwards.  We spent good 2 hours cleaning up the house (especially because it takes that long to wash and dry towels).

First of all, Carter kept in close contact until we arrived; making sure there was nothing more he could do to make our stay more enjoyable. I couldn't think of much besides a night light for my kids since it was a new environment which Carter happened to already have. Nevertheless, we had been up since 4 in the morning to catch our flight and get to Seattle which landed at 9am. After getting our rental car and heading downtown for a great breakfast and walking around Pike Place Market we texted Carter to see if he could accommodate an early check-in. Unfortunately, that didn't work out to our advantage because there were guests that checked out that morning and the cleaning lady needed every minute to get the place prepped for us. So, foolishly I had gone to the grocery store prematurely and ended up taking the fan to Lincoln Park which I have to say might be one of my favorite parks--EVER! It's just a 5 minute drive from Carter's place and it's a must do. Go get lost in one of the many trails of red wood trees and stroll down to the beach (no sand, all stones--yet, GORGEOUS). So, although we were unable to check-in early it ended up being a good thing else we most likely hadn't have stumbled onto Lincoln Park. When 3 o'clock rolled around we were exhausted and honestly, a tad on the edge but as soon as we walked in the door we were immediately at peace! It was so much bigger and nicer than I had anticipated. It was IMMACULATE and the views were just absolutely breath taking. I'm from California and I am spoiled rotten with views and sunsets but this place still made my jaw drop and my family was super stoked too! I have no complaints whatsoever, it had everything you could possibly need including very nice kitchen ware (I love to cook). It was also nice that there were spices, in addition to other unexpired items left behind in the fridge from prior guests. We ended up leaving quite a few things behind too--so enjoy! Oh! And the shower in the master bedroom was incredible, as was the jacuzzi tub which we were all able to enjoy, especially the girls. Carter definitely set the bar high for other Airbnb hosts--he's definitely got it all figured out and doesn't take short cuts as far as quality goes. I could go on but I'm reaching my limit--so, in summation, if you're willing to commute to the city (10 min max) this place is a gem and you should look no further. But do be aware that there is a cleaning fee of $100 PLUS state tax which I did not see until after I booked--probably my fault for being too excited to read the fine print.

The studio is located in the beautiful Capital Hill area. Do yourself a favor and check out the beautiful homes as you stroll to Volunteer Park. 

There are bus stops within a couple of blocks of the house and I found getting around Seattle very simple. The bus drivers I encountered were kind and helpful.

As mentioned, plenty of books and some fun board games to entertain ourselves with once we got back in the evenings.

There was no toaster in the unit; Neha went out and bought one for me.  Much appreciated!

It's good to know ahead of time that access to the parking is in an alley between 2nd and 3rd off battery. It's an unmarked garage door.  Bell street is closed, so be prepared for that. A good thing, keeps it quiet.
The keylock to get into the building is very unusual.  It's to the left of the door in the wall; a special slot, separate from the standard front door key hole.  I had to call Neha to figure that out after some frustrating minutes.
Overall, a great place-quiet, light, well-furnished.  I'd recommend a dresser for the unit or shelves in the closet at some point for those of us with longer stays.

Craig greeted us when we arrived, showed us around the studio, and made us feel at home. He was quite gracious, striking the perfect balance between welcoming host and respectful landlord. We felt as if John and Craig were there for us if we needed anything, but allowed us to do our own thing and have our own space.

The studio itself was very comfortable. About the size of a hotel room, split between two levels, it is definitely not huge, and the upstairs area around the bed is limited. So there isn't a ton of storage space, but we thought it was enough.  The neighborhood is lovely, quiet, and a few blocks from Volunteer Park.  It is a bit removed from the commercial center of Capitol Hill -- about a mile's walk to the first set of shops, and another half mile or so to the Pine/Pike corridor. We rented a car for part of our stay, and were able to park it in the lot at the studio which was incredibly convenient. Ubers and public buses were also easily accessible to/from the studio.

It was warm & cozy despite the winter rain outside, and Nan's attention to detail really made us feel welcome and at home. Since Doug works offshore and I'm a full-time grad student, we often do not have as much time together as we would like. For this get-away, we were looking for a place that was quiet and private, where we could either hunker down at ""home"" with a bottle of wine, or go exploring; we both agreed that we could not have imagined a more perfect place. 

The location was perfect for us, too; the #40 bus was our go-to. A short ride to Ballard took us to the Locks for a brisk walk along the water (cormorants fishing, eagle circling, heron preening, seal barking), and then to Walrus & Carpenter for a sublime dinner of oysters & small plates; a longer ride south to 3rd & Main took us to the ID for dim sum at Jade Garden. We spent a day downtown admiring regional art & in the Market gathering wine & picnic goodies to take on the ferry to Bainbridge; it is a perfect way to spend a rainy afternoon! We spent a little time kicking around the lovely Fremont, and went antiquing (found a great vintage modern coffee set!) at Seattle Antiques Mall on the waterfront and on Capitol Hill, where we enjoyed Molly Moon's homemade ice cream (earl grey for her; ""walnut maple bourbon crunchy something-or-other"" for him) and a phenomenal meal of smelt, mussels, and salmon at Sitka & Spruce (in the Melrose Market) for our last dinner in town. 

In summary: TOP NOTCH! We hope to be back very soon!

I was in Seattle from LA, CA to get medical care and Jess and Joey could not have been nicer or more genuine people. My husband and I were so lucky to have found this place and Jess and Joey. The neighborhood is very nice. It is on a fairly busy street, but that is convenient for getting around. If you are VERY sensitive to noise they do have wood floors upstairs and people walking during the day (as I noticed from an earlier review) but honestly it has not bothered me and I was sleeping a lot of the time during the day due to my health treatments. I don't like most hotel rooms at all so it was a real blessing to find this place. I would recommend you stay in any of the places J&J have to rent. The place is clean, comfortable and has all you need. If you want to be near downtown and the nightlife you will have to travel a bit but after seeing that area I would rather be here.

She also had notes posted throughout the apartment, explaining how to use appliances, what to do for check out, etc. This is all in the house manual as well, but it was helpful to have reminders! Parking was always available, which was great since we had a rental car. I also appreciated all the magazines and guides about Seattle. My friend and I enjoyed flipping through them for ideas during our trip. We didn't interact with Kerry much after the first day, but she made sure we knew we could contact her with any questions.

It is a one bedroom with a study but with no doors dividing  the rooms except bathroom, but plenty of space! The pictures are exactly what you get. If you are looking for a cozy place to stay with an awesome family above you this place is it. You can hear some rumblings from upstairs but they don't start before quiet hours end in the morning and they end by 10:30 every night. If you want a quiet place to be in Seattle but not hear the bustle this place is great. Quick 20 minutes to get downtown Seattle on the bus, literally a 3 minute walk from the door of the apartment. The neighborhood is quite lovely too. If you stroll along 73rd towards 5th there are lovely homes and shops as well. The entire family were great hosts!

35911,5471427,30981992,2015-04-30,20576297,Robert,"First of all this host is new to Airbnb so has some glitches that more experienced hosts have found out about and do not do. These are mostly newbie mistakes that other hosts have had enough experience to rectify so they are no longer experienced by guests.

One problem I had that  is not the hosts fault but I will mention anyways is my vehicle had a side window broken while parked where I was told to park and a computer stolen. This has cost me over 1000.00 to rectify, a new computer being the bulk of this cost.

The host through feedback has been better able to explain his dwelling on his AirBnb site.

On his site he describes 10:00 PM being the beginning of quiet time. From the day I got there till I felt the need to go to a hotel for 1 night it was loud. The loudness was solved for me by my host providing a fan to create white noise when I came back even though he insisted that different people have different levels that they think are loud. At the end of my month stay there AirBnb investigated and reimbursed me on my credit card for the night I had to leave near  1:00 AM to get some sleep. If fan noise bothers you, you may want to take this into consideration. 

2 weeks prior to my stay I was informed by my host there would be no kitchen rights. I agreed to this since I felt I had not enough time to research and find another place. When I arrived I found out that the home was full of college and post college kids and my room was in the basement next to the washer/dryer. I am an older adult. I also found out my host would not be in the home but his business partner would sometimes be there and sometimes not. One time when I was talking in the basement with one of the young adults there the business partner sleepily showed up to join the conversation and when the young adult commented he did not know he was there he replied ""You can never  know when I am here."" Not something I would expect someone to say in a business. Something you say to children so they behave. The young adults except for the other AirBnb guest have long term leases. Everybody but me had kitchen rights, even the other AirBnb guest. A more experienced host would not give everybody kitchen rights except for one person. I never got kitchen rights.

The host did not believe in paper towels but I was able to talk him into allowing me to buy them to cover my inroom microwave food so it would not splash and then taking them for a walk to dispose of them in public trash can. He eventually bought plastic covers after I had already bought paper towels, and dusters.

I wish him well and success.

They left instructions telling me how to get in if they happened to be gone when I arrived.  They were home when I got there, and both of them were very gracious and friendly hosts.  They showed me the things I needed to know about, and even provided some beverages for me in the fridge and energy bars on the counter.  Everything I needed was right there, with a complete kitchen, bath with a nice shower, and a very comfortable bed.  The apartment suited me very well, with a great location just north of downtown Seattle.  It's also a terrific walking neighborhood, with tremendous views of the city and Sound just a short distance away.  Ray and Eileen have provided numerous resources in the apartment to familiarize guests with the area and things to do.  I locked myself out within minutes of arriving and Ray's warm attitude helped me to feel like less of a goof for doing so.  I'm sure that he and Eileen are equally helpful with any of their guests' needs.  When I return to the Seattle area I will first check the availability of this nice Queen Anne apartment.

19804,4776823,27783870,2015-03-11,11977460,Sanja,"The review merits one star because the apartment itself was quite nice.   We're really sorry to say that after several really positive experiences on airbnb, this overall experience was a minus - big time. 

We were passing through Seattle for one night, and thought it'd be nice to stay downtown for a birthday celebration.  We contacted the host and relayed that we liked the place, but thought the price was a little high.  

Here is exactly the message that we sent to this host:  ""Here's what I'd like to propose. If you are willing to waive the cleaning fee and simply rent at the advertised rate of $99/night, then we are all in. If not, we'll just move along and get in touch with the other places that are nearby. Thanks for the response and the understanding."" 

We received no response from the host, but we did get an airbnb approval, and thought we were all good to go.  

Sadly, this was the last good news we got from this rental. 

Prior to our arrival, it was clear that Jen was not in the least bit happy about having to waive the cleaning fee or what she considered a discounted price.  As we neared Seattle after a long day on the road, we emailed at around 5 pm to let her know that we were on the way.  Here is her message to us: 

""It is ready so I don't mind checkin now but I have scheduled the next guest tomorrow AM-  Sorry for any inconvenience. I need check out by 10am and linens washed, tidy up, etc as we discussed."" 

Firstly, we never discussed anything as she had barely communicated anything other than copy/paste instructions.  Secondly, we had booked according to her listed terms - 2 pm check-in and an 11 am check-out.  Nothing else was discussed.  The communication was so bad that as we went to check-in, we were ""buzzed in"" (by Jen, we can only assume) with no ""hello"" or other greeting, and it wasn't until a phone call was placed that we were told to ""go on in the door is open"".   Thirdly, there was no guest booked the next day (easy to see from the calendar after all).  She even said in a later exchange we could book it another night (!!).  

All in all, this was an incredibly disappointing booking and put a real damper on an otherwise awesome trip to a great city.  And this was the first negative experience we've had on airbnb.   

We're sorry that it turned out this way, but if you can find a way to work with Jen then the place itself is not so bad.  Just don't make the mistake of not paying her full asking price as an airbnb property manager, or you might find yourself wishing you had booked elsewhere.   

Best of luck to you!  ",Firstly we never discussed anything as she had barely communicated anything other than copypaste instructions,-1

I needed a place to crash for an extended stay for a visit with friends and a conference downtown (20 minute walk). I think this is a great spot for a weekend or a few days and you know you'll be eating out most of the time. If you are staying for more than 3 days, probably better to get a place with a small fridge or microwave (and a shower). I was happy with the tub and I knew there was no shower going into it. The second bed in the front room is nice, but one of my friends complained about the noise of the plastic covering the bed (the front room is not as nice and you have to walk through it to get to the toilet). The back room is very cozy and it was good to have wifi and use of the laundry room. You do hear the family upstairs (which didn't bother me) and some nights it would get pretty cold (but the large space heater solved this problem in the back room). Even though this has a separate entrance, it is not a stand alone unit, it definitely feels like you are staying in a room in someone's ""lived in"" house. Erika was very friendly and accommodating when my friend needed to park in the driveway and when I needed to have a package delivered to the house.

Leah let it be known that she was available and enthusiastic to give us advice about the neighborhood, but totally left us to our own devices.

Half my party moved on and was replaced by another family during our stay, and the host was helpful in providing ample clean linens ect. for the transition. The listing page is for a unit with 3 sleeping spaces.  One is a proper bedroom, the other has a sofa/trundle bed that is large enough for 2.  Firm alone and wonderful with the pad.  The living room area has a pull out sofa bed.  This mattress is very thin, the pad actually has to go here if anyone is using this bed.  I had thought it had four sleeping spaces from the pictures, but there are actually 2 pictures of the same room with different futons.  The bus to downtown is very convenient, and it is easy to take bus and light rail to and from SEA TAC.  It was unusually hot when we visited and the convenience of a bus line a block away was very helpful.  I did not rent a car, and didn't miss it.

This old house has a lot of character and has clearly been a labour of love for Glen and Rose. It would rate as  'well loved' in UK parlance.The property is well equipped. There is a large deck at the back and a hot tub, which we made full use of. In terms of location, the Burke-Gilman trail is a few minutes walk and you can use this as an alternative route into Fremont, the main route being Leary Way, a busy four lane road which the deck partly overlooks. Consequently there is road noise during working hours but inside the house you don't hear it at all. Fremont is only ten minutes walk and buses 28 or 40 stop on Leary Way taking you downtown in 20-25 minutes. Probably the only change we would make is a visitor information pack about basic domestic appliances and local travel/restaurants but most people will work things out pretty easily. A tip for UK families with teens, the USA licensing laws prevent sale of alcohol to under 21s and this rules out meals at many establishments. Norm's Diner along Leary is an option. If you visit the Locks we liked Bitteroot a small bar in Ballard where again under 21s can dine with parents enjoying a beer. Overall we enjoyed our four days stay.

Although we did not meet Rachel and Grace in person, their communications with us were always very prompt, clear and friendly.

The location of this property is very convenient both for walking to food and entertainment on Rainer Street at night and proximity to the Seattle-Tacoma airport upon arrival or departure. 

The studio itself is small but well laid out. Upon entering the space via the front door you are met with the bedroom. A short hallway ahead of you contains the door to the bathroom and opens into the kitchen. The space is efficient and well laid out. The ceilings are very low in this space so if you are taller than 6' expect to feel a bit cramped. 

As other reveiwers have mentioned, noise is a problem here. The neighbors aren't overly loud but do have animals and play music late into the night. The walls and ceiling do little to block any sound from the surrounding units. Additionally the drain pipes from the units above run down the far wall of the kitchen so when an upstairs neighbor flushes a toilet expect a loud watery swoosh. Samantha provides a white noise machine to help in this respect. My girlfriend and I slept well but we are not particularly light sleepers. 

If your goal for this booking is to have a cozy place to sleep with plenty of value and a great host, Samantha and her studio definitely fit the bill. Should we be in the area again, we will definitely be staying here (with more notice this time Samantha).",Upon entering the space via the front door you are met with the bedroom,0

Great instruments and pool table. Little interaction with host, but was very nice and came by to check in on day 3.

Just a few things to note... the bed is a small queen (or a double bed) so it is a cozy for 2 adults. There is no couch, just chairs for sitting. There are two steps to get into kitchen and bedroom in case you have small children. There is not a place to eat indoors (the patio is fantastic of there is nice weather though).  About 15 minutes from downtown = $15 uber ride (lots of drivers in the area).  If planning on cooking meals there, they have a lightly stocked kitchen.  Good for  simple meals.

20703,4461706,43577217,2015-08-20,13009595,Amber,"Tom (and Buster!) were wonderful hosts. We were introduced to the airstream and given the rundown of how everything worked as it was our first time staying in one. We also asked about the neighborhood and their beautiful home and it was wonderful to learn so much about both. It was a real treat to stay in Seattle's first neighborhood and Tom and Buster could not have been more welcoming and kind.

The airstream was very comfortable and quite spacious. The bed was cozy and the sheets soft. We enjoyed the cool Seattle nights and leaving the windows open to the breeze. It was a treat to experience coming from the heat of Arizona! The bathroom was also more spacious than I expected and showering and getting ready wasn't any problem at all.

I'm sure the kitchen set up would have worked well, but Columbia City was a 10-15 minute walk and provides plenty of dining options, so we enjoyed an amazing dinner at the Thai restaurant. The light rail isn't much further, so it is incredibly easy to head into Seattle 'proper' as we called it to explore or to head to SeaTac for flights.

Tom and John's place really is the perfect location. I love historic neighborhoods and theirs does not disappoint. If you stay, I hope you give yourself a few hours to walk around and enjoy admiring the homes. I was delighted by the architecture and variety of styles. I'm not sure if they do home tours in the area (we do plenty in the Phoenix area as fundraisers for our historic neighborhoods) but I would travel back to Seattle just to attend a home tour of this area. They day after my husband and I went on our own walking tour of the neighborhood, Tom took us on an extended driving tour of the neighborhood and pointed out even more amazing homes...and we got some stories about them! I loved it :)

If you are lucky enough to stay when the little strawberries from their rain garden are ripe, make sure to try them. They really shouldn't call them strawberries. They should call them flavorbombs. I don't think I've ever had anything more delicious in my life. Only with Airbnb, right?

 My main concern was confusion with Terry’s rules on “unregistered guests” and a call out to potential guests. From my messages I felt I was upfront that my entire family would be in the same area with me, using multiple airbnb hosts.

My family arrived from a 15 hour flight Sunday afternoon and decided to have take out and eat dinner together at Terry’s airbnb. The next morning I received a message from Terry that there were reports of unregistered guests staying “most of the time” at her house. I explained to her that my sister’s family just came over for dinner. She asked me to the review our messages and her posting on house rules.

After reviewing our message history and the description of the place, I did not see any explicit mention from Terry prohibiting visitors from coming over. The only mention I could find was in the Terry’s house rules listing stating “we don’t appreciate parties in the house with people not staying at the house without prior approval”. Again, the only time my other family members were over was a short Sunday dinner. It was not a party. I explained to Terry that my sister’s family was staying in another airbnb and not staying in her house.  I received a message from her that no visitors are allowed to come over, apart from the 5 adults that were registered because of liability issues.

After Terry made me aware of the liability issues she face from having visitors over, I let my family know because I did not want to put Terry in jeopardy with that or her neighbors. Terry did allow my family to come for quick visits between the hours of 12 – 7 pm however, it was disappointing and embarrassing for me to tell my family that there were restrictions for other family members. My sister’s Airbnb host graciously allowed my family to use her house as meet up spot going forward.

This is the first time I’ve encountered a “no visitor: restriction with airbnb so I did not think to ask this before booking this house.

It is truly a mid-twentieth-century home, as represented, fixtures dated, but overall immaculate. It is even more charming than the pictures, serene, with many personal touches. I walked in the neighborhood, very pleasant, with a long stairway down to the trail that borders Lake Washington. Bed was very comfortable. The room is around the corner of the house from her sleeping quarters, so while you are sharing a home, it is pretty private.

All four of us were so pleasantly surprised at the quality of the accommodations as well as the hospitality of our host.  The host e-mailed me in advance and asked me if I needed anything.  I mentioned a coffee maker and said we would bring our own coffee.  She laid out clear instructions for us on getting there as well as getting the key conveniently if we arrived late.  

When we arrived the place was so warm and welcoming.  She gave us a bottle of wine and when we opened the fridge there was a bottle of water for each of us as well as cherries which was so generous and thoughtful.  We also noticed that she had coffee for us in the freezer but we had brought our own.  The stove was nice and they had furnished everything with quality items from the cookware to the eco-friendly dish washing soap and detergent.  We were so pleased with the care and consideration they took to make the place comfortable for us.  I also asked our host to make the bed in the living room to accommodate our friends who was travelling with us and they were so comfortable on the pull out bed.  It looked even bigger than the queen sized bed in the bedroom!  Our host contacted us that night asked us if we needed anything.  They were so thoughtful and nice.  They sent us a message regarding a fair going on at Downtown Seattle as well as a nearby Farmer's Market as well as restaurant recommendations.

The Farmer's Market was absolutely amazing with so many fresh food and flowers we were so grateful for the recommendation.  

On the last day we came home early and I had time to do laundry which was so easy with their HE appliances.

Overall I cannot say enough good things about our experience.  They were such amazing hosts and they were there if we needed anything but always respected our privacy.  The location was very convenient.  Quiet and away from the city yet only a 15 minute drive away.  It was such a beautiful and well maintained home you can really tell a lot of love went into the furnishings and everything was so tastefully decorated and comfortable.

We couldn't have asked for anything more from Darik and the vacation rentals team.  The system is automated so we buzzed in as instructed and obtained our keys that way.  There were no issues so we never actually had any reason to meet them face-to-face.

The person who was listed in the book (Kathy) was not as helpful so I would just keep all communications with Jessica or Heather if you need someone.

Just a couple of minor issues during our stay.  The toilet seems prone stopping (as noted in the house rules book) so you should expect to do some toilet plunging during your stay (not the best way to spend a vacation).  There was a disassembled fan that seemed available for us but it was missing a piece. The TVs gave us problems throughout our stay too.  All very minor.  I would recommend this place nonetheless.

First, the good. The apartment was a clean and tidy and pretty much as described. The bed was comfy and clean. We had no issues checking in, getting the key and felt warmly welcomed.

Now, the not so good. For someone not familiar with the city of Seattle, it's hard to know prior to booking what the neighbourhood will be like. In this case, we were in for a real disappointment. Directly across the street from the second floor apartment is Pioneer Square, which at night turns into a hangout for drunks, drug addicts, and homeless people.

It is located in a charming victorian style home in a great older neighborhood called Queen Anne.  The location is so convenient to downtown Seattle that I actually walked to all the sights. Many interesting shops and restaurants just a couple of blocks away, even my old standby Trader Joes.

25752,835149,44473506,2015-08-26,9543905,Rachel,"The room is as pictured, neighborhood charming. Overall stay was fine. But I must be honest. As a conflict resolution and communications coach (teaching adults in business), I choose these words with care: 

Alexia seemed to be suffering what a friend (another airbnb host, here in San Fran) called ""guest fatigue."" When I arrived for 4-5 min to put to put my small bag in the room and leave again, Alexia did a full throated rant of past guests who have frustrated and angered her. I literally wanted to scurry away from her and not return to her place until much later. Quite a contrast to my other airbnb hosts (in other US cities, and 4 countries of Europe) who've been gracious, relaxed, mellow, downright friendly or pleasant in greeting me. 

She told me of guests who do not respect her time, who take advantage of her being 'flexible' on check in time. Mind you I had just met her, a brand new person, a brand new guest and stranger. How angry and upset she sounded was startling. I tried using sympathy and doing active listening: say to her, ""you sound upset and angry right now."" ... ""It sounds like some guests been very frustrating for you."" It didn't seem to calm her insense and upset. Her rant continued for the full 5 min I was there. I was shocked at being greeted this way by a host. 

On my way out, when she said to lock the top bolt on the front door, I warmly assured her that I would do that. She said to me, anger in her voice, ""Oh, I've had guests looking me right in the eye and say the same thing and then they didn't lock the door. Then I come home at night and find a stranger in my bathroom.""  

I understand from my host friends here in San Francisco my hometown that occassionally guests can be nutty or frustrating. AND, a host should NOT be venting about that to a brand new guest. 1 comment might be fine--but not a full 5 min of full throated venting. They need to find the appropriate people (friends, etc) to express their anger to. NOT inflict it on a brand new guest and perfect stranger who's demonstrated friendly, warm, respectful communication and behavior.

I didn't return til 8 at night, relucant to do so even that early. I then left at 7:30 a.m., eager to get away from a host who seemed so displeased with hosting. I trust Alexia will figure out how to come to a more positive manner when greeting new guests. It was startling and offputting to be met with a host who is so angry at her past guests and venting it to me without realizing that is not appropriate to do.

6757,6773472,47055719,2015-09-15,17882920,Nick,Jarad's apartment was a great way to have our own space in downtown Seattle without spending a fortune. All the popular tourist activities are within a walkable distance ( 1 mile) but you should be aware that the building is at the top of a pretty big hill so walking back from the water can take a while. There's a hotel next door which serves as an easy reference point when getting rides. You can always get a cab from there but we used Lyft instead which worked great. The building is centrally located within Seattle though it's more of a business area so there aren't many bars/restaurants close by like there are in say Belltown. Light rail to the airport stops about a 10 min walk away at Pioneer Square and works very well.  The apartment itself was clean and the bed was very comfortable and Jarad was a pleasure to deal with :),The building is centrally located within Seattle though its more of a business area so there arent many barsrestaurants close by like there are in say Belltown,1

When I arrived, I stayed in hotels far away from Capitol Hill and Westlake.   At the time, I was not able to reach the appointments to view apartments in Capitol Hill quickly.  When I arrived at the appointment, an application had already been submitted.  I felt disappointed because even though, I was putting a lot of time apartment hunting, I was not getting any results. 

Then I recognized that in order to be successful, I needed to be the fastest to submit my application, and to be the fastest I needed to be in Capitol Hill. So, I registered and signed up for Airbnb and I sent out a requests and I got positive response from Andrew.  

Andrew was superb host, he reached out to me make sure I was on my way.   Andrew provides an exemplary Airbnb experience, one of the options he has is an air mattress.   Andrew, invited me to see a movie, watch TV or play video games, which I opted out, and then the small chat with his room mate went on to a full memorable conversation.  Later Andrew's roommate offered to show me the amazing view from the roof.    It was dark so the view was missing the mountains but the the lights on the  buildings look incredibly bright and colorful. 

Andrew and his roommate are exceptional at hosting.    They are young, energetic, interesting, smart, knowledgeable, friendly, caring, athletic, fun and professional hosts.     I did not notice anything out of place, they were prepared to host.   They were helpful, they asked if I was comfortable, and even helped me with my next AirBnB move.  When I arrived I was tired and feeling disappointed because of my lack of success at finding an apartment, but the stay with them re-charged me.

My only issue was with the wifi. I specifically chose a place with wifi as I had to check in with work while I was out of the office in Seattle. If I didn't need wifi, I may have chosen a different place. The network name wasn't included on the sheet with the password, and it took the host 9 hours to get back to me as to which network it was. Then, the password didn't work. So finally, seven hours after that, the host came to the apartment, and upon seeing the info sheet, said that the wrong password was on the info sheet. So overall, I ended up having to use phone data (which was costly because I was in a different country) for most of my stay because they put insufficient/incorrect information on the sheet. Again, this is not a big deal if you don't need wifi, but I specifically chose a place with that amenity and for one amenity not to be included because of human error (and to cost me extra cash) was not really up to standards for me.

She quickly responded to my questions and requests. We were very happy with both her hospitality and sense to respect our privacy. 

The room itself was cute. It is tucked away in the back alley behind a store front, and is just below ground level (there are windows that are at ground level). Everything was clean when we arrived and the space had a nice, homey feel. 

Ballard was a nice neighborhood to stay in. There are many bars are restaurants on the main street, and the Odd Lodging is only about 5 minutes away from a bus stop that will take you right downtown (to most tourist spots). We happened to have a car, but you could easily get around the city without one.

The only downside of our stay at the Odd Lodging was that the actual lodge hosted a party above the room we were staying one night. Our host advised us of the party before we arrived, and we didn't think it would be a problem since we were planning to go bar-hopping that night anyways. Unfortunately, by boyfriend came down with the stomach flu that afternoon so we were stuck listening to loud music and shaking floors until well past midnight. I don't blame our host for this bad experience at all...she definitely gave us fair warning of the party.

32467,4863369,50387480,2015-10-11,33165606,Sabina,"My husband and I stayed at the Columbia City Urban Farm, Ed and Gretchen's 'Down Wing Farm' the weekend of October 9th & 10th, check in Friday check out Sunday. The room and amenities were exactly as advertised. We had a lovely time and enjoyed our stay.

With regard to ceiling height: This is a basement unit and as Ed mentions in the posting the ceiling is lower than normal. The place might not be fit for a basketball player but my husband is kinda tall, at 6'-1"", and did not have any problems. He never hit his head, the lowest point in the space is the ductwork (which is shown in the photos). So it really wasn't/shouldn't be a concern for most people.

With regard to noise: As advertised, you can hear footsteps and dog paws tapping on the wood floor above. Since it is advertised, we expected this and as such it was not a problem for us. We were gone for most of Saturday (spent our time in Seattle + went to dinner + theater) and when we returned to sleep the house was quiet. Both Saturday morning and Sunday morning we awoke (8am-ish) before we heard people & dogs stirring upstairs - so again, the noise was not a concern for us. With that said, if you plan on sleeping late or going to bed early, this might not be the place for you. However, Ed and Gretchen were both very friendly and accommodating so if you have concerns, or an early plane to catch, they probably could help you out.

Privacy: We typically stay in hotels, where we don't have to worry about other occupants. We chose this place because it advertised a private entrance. True to the advertising, the room has a private entrance and a private bath. You enter the room by first going through a 'foyer' area with a washer & dryer and a table where they keep water & tea etc for you/guests. I don't imagine that they use the W/D when the room is occupied, so it is my guess that guests have complete privacy during their stay.

Amenities: We used the outdoor shower twice during our stay. I absolutely loved it and now would like one of my own! Their gardens are luscious, even in October (I would love to see what the place is like during summer)..... I would have enjoyed 'petting' the chickens if we had time to spare.

Location: We had thought that we could walk to Columbia City & the light rail. However, with the rain, the distance was a little farther than we wanted. We gave it an attempt, but even with an umbrella we were soaked after only a block and ended up driving. On a dry day the walk would have been lovely.

The bed was amazing.... We wish we could have stayed longer and would recommend Down Wing Farm.

There is a full kitchen stocked with spices and utensils along with a fridge, which is great for those of us who are unable to eat out. For those who can, there are a small number of places within walking distance. And walk you should. There are two bus stops, #10 and #11, a large park, and such amazing looking buildings. 

The sleeping area its self is four bunks so eight beds, and each bed is wrapped in clean sheets. There is also a heavy blanket, a pillow, a full towel, and a small fan. I think there was also a thin blanket. 

Currently there is only one bathroom, so in the mornings it can be a little tricky. I say currently because during my stay a second bathroom was in progress. Just a toilet for now though.

The communal space has plenty of comfy spaces to sit and a bookshelf that holds a few boardgames. Each night I was here I would be up after 1am talking with other travelers about the day's adventures. 

While I was unable to meet the host or hostess in person, Leah was wonderful. She gave plenty of communication via email before I arrived and gave me a cell phone number to call if I needed any help. She also placed notes around the building in easy to notice spaces, such as the wifi information on the freezer door. (Michael was out of town at the time.)

Check in/check out was a breeze and flexible, I'm one of those people that leaves around 10am and returns on the last bus home. 

I did have one criticism, as I didn't not know that beds were cleaned on a daily basis! It was quite an experience wandering in the dark trying to find where my re-arranged bed had gotten too. Leah told me she'll put up a note in the future about what times the Shared Room is cleaned.

Beautiful hardwood floors, a ton of windows, spacious kitchen, comfortable bed and good pillows (a rarity in AirBnBs for some reason!) and an awesome claw-foot tub! Ross himself was very responsive when I had several minor issues and was helpful and responsible. Although Ross himself doesn't have Internet, I was able to get on Xfinity Wifi from somewhere nearby and pay for a day pass - it wasn't strong enough to stream video but I could do email and use the Internet. Obviously you can't count on that, but that was my experience (May 2015).

As other reviewers and the listing note, it is on a highway so there is constant background noise. I didn't find the noise disturbing at all, but if you're used to sleeping in a quiet country home it might not be the best place for you. I would also recommend bringing an eye mask if you like to sleep late as it gets quite bright even with the shades drawn. The building is up a large hill from the water, so be aware of that if you have physical limitations - but Uber is super cheap in Seattle and there's a hotel right next door so there are always cabs. Finally, the building lobby is a bit run-down and often had various odd smells, so I wouldn't recommend this if you're going to be entertaining important clients or something.

It was about a 20 minute walk to Pike Place and about 25 minutes to the Space Needle. All the restaurants and bars we wanted to go to were only about 10 to 15 minutes walking as well. The area is saturated with Uber drivers and we only had to wait, at most, five minutes for a pickup. 

There was a little hiccup with checking in, but this turned out to be entirely our fault because we couldn't negotiate the door to Grant's place. Since Grant was out of town when we arrived, Grant had us pick up the key from a cafe near the spot and wasn't able to show us firsthand how the door opens. I'm sure you'll be fine, because you're probably pretty smart, unlike us. But if you've got doubts, just ask Grant how the door works ahead of time. He's an expert. 

Once we did get in though, the place was bright and clean and exactly what we expected from the pictures. We were greeted with a basket of snacks and a welcome note with instructions and recommendations. The fridge had drinks and dedicated space for our stuff. 

We appreciated the creature comforts that were made available. Toothpaste, floss, body wash, towels, and most anything you'd need on a quick trip. 

Overall, it was a pleasure to book with Grant and get the opportunity to stay in his apartment for a weekend. We're definitely hoping to stay at his place again when we're back in Seattle. Give this place a look if you're thinking about staying in Capitol Hill.

We went hiking at Discovery Park just before our flight out, and it wasn't until we got to the airport that we realized we had lost the journal at the park. It wasn't worth anything, but we couldn't replace the memories recorded in it, and we had no way of going back for it. And I felt like an idiot for leaving it on the roof of the car.

I texted Tom about the situation literally as the stewardess was telling us to put our phones in airplane mode. He could have very easily said I was crazy or just politely declined. But then when we landed I got a picture from Tom of our journal. He had dropped what he was doing, driven across Seattle to this park, and found our journal. Then the next day he had it shipped to us. 

Best host ever. 

Ok now the airstream:
The airstream itself was great. The mattress was very comfy, the air conditioner and fans all worked great, the shower had plenty of hot water, and it was very clean. By the time we left my wife and I were debating buying one instead of a house. 

When we got there Tom walked us through all the airstream details such as how to maintain the temperature and making sure we didn't turn off the water heater.

I really enjoyed the coffee and book shop ""Vios"" at Third Place (6504 20th Ave NE, 15-20 minute walk or ~7 minute drive) My sister found a really good breakfast place called The Butcher and Baker (6412 Latona Ave NE driveable).

23225,387079,16652516,2014-07-31,5776472,Rachel,"Overall, this was a very nice condo in a good location.  It was clean, the beds (main and pullout) were comfortable, was in a quiet neighborhood, and was close to bus stops or within walking distance of many activities.

However, there are some things that I wish had been made clear before booking:
(1) The washer and dryer are not in the unit, but in a laundry room on the first floor.  There are 2 of each machine, hours of use, the cost is $1.50 per load, and there is no change machine.
(2) We were fully informed about the construction going on and I'd read reviews from other about the noise.  Although the manager response says that the construction is fully sealed and no dust is created, that is not the case.  There are wood walls around the lower part, but we could not open the windows even on cool days because of the amount of construction dust in the air.  If you will be there during construction, make sure to confirm that the a/c fans will be in place.  They do a very good job of blocking some of the noise and are necessary for air circulation.  
(3) The info book has incorrect information:  they do not provide laundry detergent, there was no coffee, and you have to request that the Wii game system be brought in (it's not in the unit).  
(4) There are only 4 towels.  No matter if there are 1 or 4 people, staying a weekend or 2 weeks, that is how many you will get.  There were 4 of us, staying 2 weeks.  Despite the long booking, we had to clean our own towels (at cost).  Also, you will have a set amount of other supplies:  toilet tissue, paper towels, etc.  If you are staying for more than a few days, be prepared to buy your own.

Not a reaction to the unit, but to the area:  if you plan on walking, there are many steep hills!  If you plan on walking downtown, to Pike Place, the Space Needle, and so on, you will be walking downhill there.  On the way back, there are 3-4 inclines (up to about 40%) that you will have to walk up.

Once you step through the door, the apartment-wide window/glass doors overlooking the balcony and lake are just breathtaking. Having that free flowing air constantly through the apartment made the days and nights so peaceful to start and come home to. 
The apartment overall was very cute and just what we needed to rest our heads. Everything was cleanly laid out for us upon arrival with whatever we may need [linens/food staples] available to us when ready. 
For the kitchen: we, unfortunately, did not take advantage of cooking since we were always on the go, but it is nice to have all options available.
The living room was spacious and couch comfortable to Latin together with music from her stereo staring our day off right. The bedroom was very cute with the softest pillows, sheets and mattress to sink into, and enough space to store our belongings for the five day stay. 
Location-wise, we did not take advantage of walking into downtown due to steep hills and weather conditions, but anything in the city was no more than a mile/two away to get up and go to. This made hopping from restaurants to sight-seeing downtown or in Fremont so easily accessible to experience all Amy's/our friends recommendations on our must-see/do list.

She was helpful with information on the best stop to use and route to get to the Apt. from the light rail line. The place was as pictured and had lot of travel guides and helpful information.   There was even beer in the fridge which was very much appreciated since we got in late.  This central location is good and our experience was also good. One thing summer visitors should note is there does not seem to be any AC in this Apt.  This wasn't an issue for us during our stay and I believe that Seattle rarely gets above the mid 80s but the week prior to our visit it did hit the 90s for several days and we couldn't help but think that this could have been a bummer. That kind of heat combined with fact that the Apt. Bldg. is situated next to the freeway could mean some tough noisy stuffy nights for sleeping with the windows open.  The amount of freeway noise coming from through the single pane windows even when they are closed was something we are not use to and frankly I'm surprised others haven't mentioned it. Finally if you plan to cook and eat in there is no dining table to eat at.  This probably is Nit- picking since we never did eat in but potential guests might want to take note of these things. As I said our experience was very good and I would stay there again because of the central location. Here are some notes about Seattle:  If you plan to walk, downtown Seattle has very steep hills. As far as the best places to eat, drink, buy food and package goods my advise is travel away from the water.  For example if you want to get breakfast and return to the Apt I would suggest you head east on Madison across the freeway to the The Corner Cafe it's at Madison and 10th I think.  The walk is up hill but it's not steep.  This a hospital area and is seems safe especially during the day.  If you head further east and north you will find a very Bohemian area adjacent to Seattle University where there are many more locals than tourists. This is the area where the First hill neighborhood and Capital hill neighborhoods meet this roughly at at 12th and Pike.",As I said our experience was very good and I would stay there again because of the central location,1

We were a little surprised that the room didn't look like the one in the listing, but that apparently happened by accident: wrong room posted as available, while the it was already occupied. I guess there wasn't a big difference between both, so we didn't really care.

One thing that was different was that the outside was completely overgrown and dying. Nothing like the photos. Also, contrary to other reviewers, the basement to be a bit dark and scary. This house is clearly a 1 bedroom, 1 bathroom house, that they added 2 more “rooms” in the basement. We had 3 total adults staying in the house and we all decided to sleep in the 1 room that is in the main house because the first night when someone tried to sleep downstairs, they did not feel comfortable and just the noise from our footsteps and the plumbing upstairs was very loud downstairs. The basement has 1 tiny bedroom that a bed is stuffed into, but the other bed is just around a dark corner. The basement is also where the water heater and washer and dryer is. Do not be confused like we were that there are multiple rooms. 

I do not know how it is possible to stay in this house with 8 people. There is one very small bathroom and it took just 3 of us an hour to all get ready so we could all take turns in there. The plugs in the house are in weird locations, so we couldn’t bring the hair dryer into another room to do our hair so we all had to take turns in the 1 small bathroom. 

Also, the wifi speed was incredibly slow. We were just trying to do basic internet usage, like emails and it took a long time to load anything. This was frustrating trying to get some work done at the house. 

Basic supplies were not available for us. There was no laundry detergent (just two empty bottles sitting on top of the machine), no toilet paper, no trash bags, no soap, etc. We didn’t expect a lot, but we expected basic items to be provided. Grace did let us know about the toilet paper, but we had to purchase everything else. 

The couches were comfortable. The TV was very small and only had local channels. We never were able to find anything to watch on TV the few times we were relaxing in the house. 

Finally, when we arrived, we found a small container of weed in the kitchen. It wasn’t a big deal for us 3 adults but I would hate if I had kids with me and they had found it. 

The house was quiet and I felt to be in a safe neighborhood. Coffee shop and grocery store nearby and walking distance to restaurants. We did have a great time in Seattle and felt this to be a comfortable place to stay, though not exactly as we had envisioned.

The home has the all the charm that comes with having an older home.  Since it is in the WA, there is no air conditioner and not all windows have screens, but the fans provided made some of the hottest summer days of the season comfortable, especially in the evenings when the air cooled.   The very rocky beach meant that we didn't walk the beach much, but certainly enjoyed sitting on the patio enjoying the breeze and views.

32178,719233,19020747,2014-09-05,13497715,Tim,"We enjoyed our stay at the Melrose Court Apartment. The apartment wasn't lavishly appointed, but it was a very good value considering our other options and what we were charged for our stay. The pictures aren't quite accurate, as the futon has now been replaced with a love seat/hide-a-bed combo. The hide-a-bed is only a single, however so bear that in mind. 

Other reviewer's feelings about the internet are accurate, myself and my companions were unable to get internet about 30% of the time. There are two networks available to guests though, so as long as one of the two networks are up, you're connected.

Hot water was no problem, and shower pressure was adequate from what we found. The shower head is quite low though (it sprayed no higher than my neck, standing at 6'1"") so be prepared for that. 

The apartment was ideally located near restaurants and about a 4-5 block walk from the WSCC which was an excellent distance for us and our vacation. 

Host contact was prompt, courteous and professional. 

Parking was available, but quite scarce during the day. We were fortunate in finding a space near the apartment but most areas near are 2 hour only until late, and off street parking can be expensive (20-30 dollars per day, and you have to go and pay it twice. No parking/forgetting).

74958,580815,12084811,2014-04-22,5216961,Lauren,"This apartment was perfect for vacation. It had everything you could possibly need, and it was comfortable and clean. It felt bigger than it looked because there's a hallway attached, and it has a huge closet and storage for your clothes. You can put away your suitcase and it feels like home. 

It was decorated really nicely. The kitchen was small, but stocked with everything you could need. Since it's in such a fun area we were rarely home, but we would have been comfortable cooking and eating dinner, and even having friends over for drinks. It doesn't feel like a hotel, but it also doesn't feel like someone else's apartment; it's really cozy and sweet. 

The location is great for walking to nightlife in Capitol Hill, and it's only about a 15-minute walk downtown to all of the big stores. We loved the sandwich shop and brunch spot/bar downstairs. Both had great food and no wait. There are some fun restaurants and great venues just a few blocks away; we walked during the day and took a very short cab ride at night.  

It's in a big residential building with a grocery store across the street. The big back patio would be nice in the summer. 

Lastly, don't forget to get some of Seattle's famous late-night hot dogs just up the street on Harvard. They are to-die-for, and this was in a perfect location to indulge!

I'm listing the drawbacks below, in case you have different needs than ours. I would definitely book this place again, but I can see a few of these things taking away from someone else's experience: 
1. The water never got much above body temperature, so our showers were short. 
2. The bathroom vanity is super small with no storage, so it was difficult to plug in a curling iron and store our toiletries. We had to keep them in the closet and move them back and forth the entire time. 
3. Don't bother getting the parking permit. The lot never fills up, and it's actually much less expensive to pay for parking than to pay for the permit.  
4. The heat is really hard to control. It's either on full blast or not at all. We ended up leaving it on but sleeping with the windows wide open. 
5. The sidewalk across the street is a gathering place for homeless people. The neighborhood feels VERY safe and its very nice, but there doesn't seem to be an effort to keep drunk or stoned people quiet or off the street. A few times we were woken up by loud yelling, but it never felt unsafe. It was just a little annoying.",We had to keep them in the closet and move them back and forth the entire time,-1

The space was very clean and came as advertised!  It was everything we needed for our stay in Seattle.   The place is relaxing and filled with enough amenities to stay in on a rainy day, but with so much cool stuff around you'll want to grab that rain jacket (or umbrella if you don't want to blend in) and stroll down to the plethora of amazing bars, gastropubs, fine dining, and tourist sights.  

What's not to love when you are a stone's throw from the Seattle Center, around the corner from the famous 5 Point Cafe, an easy 15-30 minute walk from Downtown, Pike's Market, or the Waterfront.  

The high walk score is no lie.  We especially loved the area on 1st and 2nd Ave between Blanchard and Bell.  My walkable neighborhood suggestions:   If you like dive bars with arcade games, pinball machines, skeeball, and shuffle boarding go to Shorty's, Lava Lounge, and the Rabbit Hole (they are all right next to each other).

We lucked out the first night of our stay and found a spot right in front of the house, but the next night we had to drive around the neighborhood for about 20 minutes before finding a spot, and if cars are parked on both sides of the street, it effectively becomes a one lane road.

The house is close to parks, perfect for morning walks, less than 15 minute walk to the lite rail station (and about 5 minutes from the bus stop), a couple of minutes walk to a Walgreens and restaurants.  The house is itself was clean, comfortable, and in great condition. Thank you so much to Carolyn as well for her hospitality throughout our stay.

13461,6032726,49515331,2015-10-04,1535162,Eugene,"My friends and I decided to vacation to Seattle to get away, relax, spend some quality time together away from work and the usual weekend activities. I have been friends with my group of guys since freshman year of college. As everyone knows, it is very difficult to stay close to your friends as life begins and people go their separate ways. But we have managed to stay very close through these past 12 years. That is why we strongly value and cherish each other's friendship.  So, it goes without saying, that we all looked forward to this trip for quite some time. 

Even though it would have been more expensive than a hotel, we decided to book an Airbnb because we wanted to stay together in the same house. When I told Susan that I would be traveling with 7 of my guy friends she replied and notified me of the house rules, which we were more than happy to abide by. Susan and I had 21 email exchanges in the span of 2 weeks. She later notified me that the basement unit was booked for the weekend, and we would be sharing the home. A minor inconvenience but She happily refunded the cost of the basement. She later asked to describe the members of my group, which I happily complied with. Although Susan made me feel unwelcome even before arrival, we decided to stick with the reservation. 

The check in process and the first day/night went smoothly. The first night we decided to grab dinner and check out the local bars. We came in around 1am and decided to order pizza from dominos. We were not intentionally loud in any way, we did not play music or even turn on the TV. The second day my group decided to check out Snoqualmi Falls. During our hike, I received a text from Susan, telling me to remind my group to keep the noise at a respectable level coming in at early hours, and also to turn down the thermostat to 67 and to notify her once that was done. At this point, my communications with Susan began to affect my trip and the mood of the rest of the guys. She texted me again later telling me that she refunded the basement unit due to the noise the night before and again reminded me to keep it down in the early hours. 

Susan's home is accurately depicted in her photos. The other reviews about her home are accurate. The only hiccup we encountered was the lack of cable tv and the kitchen faucet leaking from the top as well as the piping below.

I was always respectful towards Susan, however, she did not make my group feel welcome in any way. Her communication was often unnecessary and somewhat condescending. If she did not want a group of 8 guys to stay at her place then she should not have allowed us to book the reservation in the first place.

We felt like we were in our own world there, surrounded by a peaceful garden. I can't think of a single detail I would change. Eric was very discreet; we did run into him when he was gardening and he was helpful and friendly. The design of the bathroom, the bedroom, the kitchen... well, let's just say... by the end of our stay, we wished we lived there. Beacon Hill is an upward trending neighborhood with some great bars and restaurants -- and it's incredibly easy to drive to Capitol Hill, Georgetown, or any number of hip enclaves should Beacon Hill not have what you're looking for. Parking was available at Soaring Crane, but even if not, there are two cul-de-sacs on either side of the alley you enter Soaring Crane from where you can easily find parking with no restrictions. 

My favorite Soaring Crane memory is listening to rain fall on the leaves of the garden, feeling at peace, and best of all, at home. ",Quiet calm spotless cozy,1

We especially loved the shower with the stand-alone clawfoot tub and all the cute accessories decorating the place.

We spent our weekend in Seattle in the southern part of the city, so for us the location was perfect: a 45 minute walk or 10 minute Uber/Lyft ride from Capitol Hill. And there were lots of cute coffee shops and great Vietnamese restaurants within walking distance. M&K kindly provided a list of recommendations that we took advantage of.

The highlight of the stay was the 4th of July fireworks event. The house is right by where people gather to watch the fireworks. Our kids really enjoyed the fireworks.

There is a danger that you'll just head out downtown everyday, but don't miss walking around the streets of Capitol Hill. There are some beautiful houses and Volunteer Park is a lovely green oasis.

There are plenty of local shops and a large Safeway just around the corner which is very convenient and there are some very nice restaurants, so perfect for evenings out without having to drive the car.

We went to the UW football game Saturday night, and the Seahawks game on Sunday. Perfect location. Brian cheerfully greeted us in the morning, and my kids walked out saying how much they loved their stay and how cool Brian seemed. That speaks volumes...they are both teenagers. We will definitely book there again and highly recommend it to others. Thanks, Brian!  Cheers, Alexandra, Cole, and Courtney",The home is in a great neighborhood and very close to downtown,1

HOWEVER, the smell of cat pee was ever present and we think it came from the litter box behind a wall common with our shower Fortunately we were only in our room to shower and sleep, so it was not intolerable.  If the litter box were moved upstairs it would likely solve the problem and we've suggested that to the owner.

The access to the greenway and Green Lake was excellent.  The Lake and surroundings are beautiful.  I saw a Blue Heron perched in a tree adjacent to the lake early one morning.  My girlfriend ran the course around  the Lake and felt very safe.

Kyle and his wife were super-charming and intelligent over morning-coffee, but certainly gave me and my boyfriend plenty of privacy.

A quick walk to the other side of the hill, and you're looking at an amazing Lake Union vista.

In ever way, a better deal than staying at a hostel (same price) or even the Ace Hotel, where the thriftiest room costs a third again as much and requires you to share a bathroom down the hall. The sparkling-clean bathtub at Kyle's came with the fluffiest towels and lavender bubble bath sachets, soooo yeah, using AirBnb to stay with Kyle and his little family was a very savvy decision.

I've done a fair amount of Airbnb, and almost always have extended my stay wherever I have lived, but this was different. I left the first chance I got (which was rather soon, a couple of hours). 

First, let me begin with the good by saying that whatever little time I spent with Angielena, and the pre-arrival exchanges, she was very nice, gracious, and seemed like a very cool person I could have really gotten along with. She maintains a nice, clean, artsy place. 

Now let's talk about the place, and the rental / value aspect of the whole package. The neighborhood is a bit run down; there are demolitions and teardowns happening literally right across the street, it is noisy in the daytime as it is also right under the landing path of the airport, and I saw a fair few unsavory characters at the intersection near the place, so I'd be worried about going out in the night. 

Inside, the bathroom too is rather tiny, and quite a bit across the hall to make it inconvenient. Also, the listing says the room is 250 Sq Ft, which would be a decent size room, but in reality the room is rather tiny. Maybe a bit more than 9 feet by 12/13 feet, with an angled wall at one end. Even the tiny closet was almost full..  In a city where a 3 star hotel room with breakfast can be had for as few as US$100/day, this doesn't really offer great value, or great convenience, considering it is in a rather inconvenient part of town.

We both really appreciate Harry's and Rich's taste in interior design and furniture. Compared to most other American homes, their house feels more European/German in style and interior.

I was pleasantly surprised to find out that Rich shares my passion for coffee, so if you also a coffee enthusiast you can expect both great discussions and great coffee here. Because we only stayed two nights and had a fully booked schedule we unfortunately didn't have a lot of opportunities to talk to Harry.

We believe that Harry and Rich goes well beyond their duties as hosts and we would no doubt recommend them to our friends.",Compared to most other American homes their house feels more EuropeanGerman in style and interior,0

What I loved about this place even more so was that the style reflected my own personal style. The decor is eclectic, charming and very comforting. Sean supplied everything that we could possibly need. The location is also wonderful. We utilized both the light rail and the bus followed by a short walk to get to the apartment from the airport. This saved us about $40 on a taxi. The bus stop was about three blocks away but we ended up just walking everywhere. We found that we could get downtown in about 20-30 minutes. Also a few blocks away on Broadway St. (?) there are plenty of (website hidden) shops/grocery/etc. Definitely check out Taco Chuki's for some of the best tacos you will ever have.

My co-worker/friend and I stayed there for 3 nights while we attended a conference at the “Hutch”—which was a short and pleasant walk away.  The photos give a good sense of the space—it was very clean throughout and so thoughtfully and eclectically decorated in a way that made me want to come home and re-do my whole now-boring house :)   We never met Heidi in person, but she was quick to reply with any questions and left really helpful notes about wifi, supplies,recycling, etc.  The lockbox was great—not only for easiest check-in and check-out—but really perfect for sharing space with another person who doesn’t necessarily have the same itinerary.  I will note, as other reviewers have, that the apartment is on a hilly street and up a bunch of stairs on top of that.  It made it a bit challenging for me (wearing an air-cast boot), but it was workable. One other note: from the larger bedroom, with the windows open, the highway noise might disturb a lighter sleeper (really didn’t bother me though).

The main thing was the spiders that strung webs across the walkway around the house all day every day. A couple of times we narrowly avoided huge spiderwebs in the face; every other time we cleared it out with a broom handle before trying to walk through. Six hours later there'd be another one. Yes, this is life in Planet Earth sometimes. But it was still not fun.

The mattress was (in my opinion) very firm, so I didn't sleep very well.

Other than those two things it's a nice place!

We got around mostly by bus. It seemed about as accessible as anywhere else in Seattle, in that you have to transfer downtown to get anywhere from anywhere. There is a bus stop nearby.

His is a personality that fits the cozy warmth of the wooden caravans he's built in their backyard.  We (Ed and Amelie)  occupied the Spruce Caboose for three nights.  I was initially concerned about being so close to busy 15th, but there was no problem with noise.  The caboose is also water-tight and well-ventilated, both necessities in the unpredictable Seattle summer climate.  There was also protected WiFi from the wagon. The shared bathroom and living area inside the house operated very smoothly, like the cleanest, quietest hostel I've ever seen.  We'd wake up to golden sunshine filtering in through the stained glass windows, roll off the bunk, walk across the lawn, and say ""hello"" to the adorably shaggy-eared rabbit in the hutch by the garden.  Going inside the Dutch backdoor, we'd wait no longer than a polite 15 minutes (but usually not at all) for the shower, enjoying a coffee or tea in the swinging chair in the backyard.  Loads of clean towels, color-coded by caravan, were stacked daily in the bathroom cabinet, and on the wall were drying hooks a-plenty.

The neighborhood was very quiet for being in a large city - we didn't hear any neighbors or traffic noise.

This home was a great solution for us and we very much enjoyed our stay.
Our contact was Mary, the receptionist for the owner and she did a wonderful job of communicating promptly and answering any questions that came up.
The location is wonderful being right on the waters edge of Puget Sound.  The sight, sound and smell of the sea was charming and soothing.
The property is a very well equipped and a somewhat quirky older home.  It is actually two stories and there are 29 stairs to walk down to access the home.  This is something to consider if you have seniors as we did.  Someone in a wheelchair would not be able to get to the house at all.  I had forgotten to inquire so no fault to the owner.  And fortunately, our seniors where able to negotiate the stairs.
On the first floor is a very well stocked kitchen, something I greatly appreciated!  All the cookware, dishes, glasses, toaster, silverware, and knives, enough to cook for a group, which we did.  There was also one bedroom and a bath on that floor. As well as a large open dining room/living room with wide open views of the water as well as a fireplace and wood provided too!   In addition, there is access to a deck on two sides of the first floor.
On the lower level are another bathroom and two bedrooms.  There is a door through one of the bedrooms which allows access to the beach and a sitting area with a fire pit surrounded by several aderondack chairs.  Wish our stay had been longer to have been able to use it.
If you are looking for new and contemporary this is not the place.  If on the other hand you enjoy charming, quirky and older, then this might be the location for you.
One other thing I should mention is that the area where this home is located is down a secluded road with only one way in or out and there is parking for only one vehicle.  There is more parking on an adjoining street about a half block away.

Host: Nick was friendly and very accommodating since we arrived around 10PM. Luckily he works nearby, so he personally walked us to the studio and showed us all the necessities in the studio (e.g. lighting, TV, etc.). He also left his contact info in case we needed anything.

Place: The studio's front door is programmed differently by Nick for every stay. The place is completely furnished with a TV, Bose speaker system, kitchen, queen-sized bed, table + 3 chairs, couch, large comfy chair, and washer and dryer in the bathroom. The place has these neat wall stickers that make the place even more hip. Also the balcony area has a view of the Space Needle (you can actually find this place from the Space Needle if you look hard enough). Only downside is we weren't sure how to activate the AC unit, so we just opened the windows (which was fine). This place is perfect for any individual or couple.

The condominiums also have this 3rd floor garden area, indoor swimming pool, gym, and common area complete with a kitchen. Elevators are super fast here so there's not a lot of waiting. Funniest thing about this place is that the hallways smell like food, as in the first floor restaurants' food (which was completely fine with me and only made me hungrier when venturing out).

Neighborhood: Extremely great area, the condominiums comprise of an entire block with some 4+ star restaurants, bakeries, etc. on the base floor. We literally would walk outside and grab pastries in the morning or get sushi at Shiro's. Plus the neighborhood has a ton of places to eat, drink, and stay open late all within walking distance. The whole Belltown area is pretty safe, even at night, so it's easy to walk around and explore without a worry.

Overall: This place is perfect for any couple or individual wanting to explore Belltown, Pike's Market, and the Space Needle area with or without a car. Very safe, tons of fantastic food options, and comfortable place. I highly recommend this place (and Nick) and I will probably be back here again.",Only downside is we werent sure how to activate the AC unit so we just opened the windows which was fine,-1

I like to explore and see places where I visit so staying in Downtown Seattle would serve me little, hence Carol's place was the perfect location. The buses to Downtown are regular at 20 minutes interval and one can choose between the 71 route which takes you to many places and before it goes to Downtown, or the faster one which is 65, which one can connect to other buses  from University of Washington en-route to Seattle Downtown.

Carol's place is quiet, neat, comfortable, warm and very homely. I like the kitchen very much as it is designed in a circular fashion and one only has to turn around in circles to reach everything in the kitchen.  Carol is kind, open and friendly and takes time to discuss topics of interest and takes interest in the guests as well which is great attribute. 

I would recommend anyone wishing to explore a bit of Seattle and who is also looking for budget accommodation to choose Maple Creek House, trust me, I can bet on this that you will enjoy your stay.

His room and en-suite bath were sparkling and comfortable and his hospitality was gracious.  We simply wanted an affordable place to stay during our hectic work week and we came away with a new appreciation for the Phinney neighborhood and a friend in Sheldon.  In addition to a restful reprieve, Sheldon was very warm in making us feel at ease.  Moreover, we thoroughly enjoyed our conversations with him.  Sheldon has a wealth of experience and a comprehensive understanding of Seattle, Phinney and nearby neighborhoods.  We are Seattleites and highly recommend Sheldon's home as a place to stay if in need of a home for temporary living.

It was a quiet haven away from everything else we had to deal with in Seattle this time. It's sometimes hard to believe just how close it is to shops, etc & how far it is away from the hustle & bustle.

I recommend using the small paddleboat as often as possible. I was able to pull it out & launch it on my own, & it was easy to pull it up onto the pier & turn it over to keep the top side dry.

She made my stay special with her detailed and helpful suggestions on places to visit, where to eat, have a good coffee. .. She even allowed  me to visit the Seattle Art Museum  and the Asian Art Gallery for free on her Dual Membership Card (the entrance charge would have been a hefty 20 $) and let me ride her bike for a symbolic maintenance contribution.  She also offered to pick me up at the railway station on my arrival day and took me back there (at 6.30 am!)  when I left.  As a plus she takes care of the washing up  of  crockery and cutlery in the kitchen,.

Alexia's home is a charming two-storey wooden-floor  house, in typical ""Capitol Hill style"", with a private yard and a porch overlooking a front garden. She  has two guest bedrooms at the main floor.  The room I stayed in was very comfortable, spacious and bright (two windows!); a well-aired bathroom is right across; next door there are a fully furnished kitchen (with free tea and coffee for the  guests) and a large living room.
 The surrounding area is leafy and absolutely quiet both day and night; yet it is just a few steps away from the always animated Broadway Avenue  (for any shopping necessities  there is a good QFC supermarket open 24 hours). 
There are excellent cafés and eateries nearby.  And Capitol hill is a such wonderful place just to wonder around on foot or by bike...  Beautiful Volunteer park is a short walk away: ideal for relaxing under the sun and catching the  last rays at sunset.  The Asian Gallery in the park is really worth a visit and, if you  climb the water tower,  you'll enjoy great views of the city.  Buses to downtown are a few steps away but you can easily walk if you like (a little more than 30 minutes downhill).

Location is excellent, surrounded by lots of restaurants and right next to a Whole Foods for groceries.

The Space Needle and EMP Museum are also an easy walk away. All this for the same price as a basic hotel room. Highly recommend. The only note I would add is that the bedroom area is semi-private, with a partial wall separating it from the kitchen and small living room, but open to the front door.

Also, she let us keep our bags in there a little after checkout, so we didn't have to lug them around the city before leaving. That was a huge help and definitely unnecessary as I asked her an hour before check-out.

We really enjoyed the central location and Lauren's hospitality, especilaity her flexibility with our flight arrival time.  The second floor apartment is perfect for the active explorer.  We walked to Seattle Art Museum, Aquarium,  Pike's Market, and had a lovely picnic in the nearby Freeway Park with yummy sandwiches and european sodas from from the nearby George's Deli.

 The apartment is well lit and we enjoyed the vintage building and decor with the great ventilation the windows provided- especially while cooking.  The antique clawfoot tub is nice for a relaxing deep hot soak after a day in the city.   The kitchen is well equipped for a nice blackened Alaskan King Salmon dinner after foraging for ingredients at Pike's Market The new City Target and Kress Supermarket are also walkable as well as some nice pubs and fine dining.  Kress has a nice selection of prepared foods and  local produce at reasonable prices.  We took the train from the airport and were happy without a car.  This is a very walk friendly city with easy to use public transport.  We also took the bus to the Flight Museum- another must see.   I would also recommend Fran's chocolates downtown for a nice steaming cup of hot chocolate using single origin Venezuelan chocolate made to order with local organic stamed milk. Easy to take a break at Fran's on the way to the museum or Pike's.  Britt's pickles adjacent to Pike's Market is also a gem - live culture kim chee and pickles the old fashioned way. We liked the extra hot and ginger flavors.  On a different visit- dont miss the black licorice ice cream across the way from Britt's.

It was calm and peaceful start and finish surrounding some pretty busy and hectic days. A friend was able to visit for a night from Portland and was very comfortable on the twin bed in the sunroom. The bed upstairs was just as comfy as everyone says it is. We were fortunate Roger was around during most of my/our stay and we enjoyed many conversations. It was miraculously sunny for three entire days at the beginning of my visit and the front deck was the perfect place for a relaxing cup of coffee prior to the day's activities. Thanks for the lattes Roger. The garden behind the house was private, cozy and just beginning to burst into spring growth. I could not have chosen a  more beautiful time to visit Seattle as all the trees and tulips and many other flowers were in full bloom. It was gorgeous! 
I had a car Sat-Mon and parking was always available within a few doors of the house. I returned the car at the end of the weekend and used mass transit for the rest of my visit. The house in Wallingford was very accessible with multiple lines running within 2-6 blocks away. After climbing almost 300 steps straight up at a stop near my son's apartment in another area of town, I appreciated the accessibility in Wallingford even more. I also appreciated a soak in the tub-no sore muscles! 
I was fortunate to get a host-lead tour of neighboring Fremont prior to the end of my stay. I saw many things I would have otherwise missed with many remaining to be seen on my next visit. Before you leave the house, be sure to check out Roger’s handmade glass bug collection (read the names) and play a few tunes on the guitar if you get the chance.

Communication throughout was excellent and I really felt like Sarah cared that we had a good experience.  Regarding the accommodation:
 
Positives:  The location is absolutely excellent, on top of a hill with views down to Lake Washington one way and to the city centre and Puget Sound the other way.  In fact we loved to sit out on the back porch as the sun set over the downtown sky scrapers.  The weather was magnificent while we were there, and Lake Washington is scattered with lovely little very well managed beaches which the kids swam at the whole summer; Mount Baker Beach is a (fair) walk from the house as is Leschi Park but both manageable. Also there is a lovely Italian restaurant just up the road and a very nice but expensive market at the bottom of the hill on Lake Washington. The number 14 bus literally stops outside the front door and gets you to the centre of Seattle in about 20 minutes.  Inside the house has everything, the kitchen is really well equipped and nice to cook in, the shower is powerful and the TV room is cosy. The beds were very comfortable, even the inflatable which our youngest slept on.  
 
Could be better:  when we were there it was very warm and there is no aircon – this is normal considering Seattle's climate though but it meant that we had to have the windows open at night and the road is noisy.  The bus stop is right outside (see above) which added to this - it woke us up a few times.  Really the road is not tremendously busy, but if you are a light sleeper I would consider earplugs.  Additionally the first impression of the house from the outside is not too good at the time of writing – you need not worry though as inside is just lovely.  
 
Overall we had a wonderful stay there and would totally recommend Sarah and the house.",Could be better  when we were there it was very warm and there is no aircon – this is normal considering Seattles climate though but it meant that we had to have the windows open at night and the road is noisy,-1

The house is in a great neighborhood. You have Trader Joe's right across the street, literally. AND lots of fantastic restaurants, cafe, gift stores, etc. surrounded. This would be the perfect neighborhood to live in. All the things- within walking distance.

You'll be sharing a bathroom with other roommates (but that wasn't a problem for me at all). If you're looking for a place to crash that's within walking distance to everything, this is perfect for you.

They work downtown and were able to pick me up and drop me off at the light rail station which I took to/from the airport. They are very friendly and knowledgeable about Seattle. Stan will bend your ear with a poetic narrative of dozens of stories from a life well-lived. Carrie brews a mean cup of cowboy coffee! And Rocky, the Australian Healer, will give you all the love you can handle. Mind the gray dog hair (but he sleeps topside). The accommodations are what you'd expect from an aging sailboat - tight quarters, no TV and a toilet for #1 only. Hot showers and bathroom are right onshore. While Stan and Carrie would make any stay enjoyable (and they're right on the boat with you), the big bonus here is the VIEW! Amazing sunsets featuring rows of sailboats with the Puget Sound and Olympic Mountains forming the backdrop. The beach at Golden Gardens Park is a short walk. Plan your transportation if you don't want to rely on Stan chauffeuring you around. I believe there is a bus stop nearby (I didn't use it) and I also believe you could park your car or motorcycle at the marina. I rented a bike from Dutch Bicycle a few miles away.

She was great with the communication! When we had a problem with the fridge, she came right down and fix it immediately. 

It is about 30 minutes from downtown which was a bit of a disappointment but the price was too hard to beat! The public transportation is pretty easy to follow and you can get an ORCA card for an all day pass so we didn't need to rent car or use Uber/Lyft at all. It was also convenient that Maddy's place was literally across the street from the bus stop for downtown. Overall, the studio was sufficient space for my boyfriend and me.  I can see why more than two would be a tight squeeze. The bed was comfortable and, in the hallway, Maddy provided a mini fridge, coffee make, and microwave. It was clean and it does remind me of a fancy motel stay.There were plastic forks, knives, and spoons but I'm not sure if Maddy provides the plastic utensils or if they were left by previous tenants because we ran out of spoons. It was not a big deal, we just went to the local grocery store and brought a box. I did like the Westwood Complex which has a Target, QFC, restaurants, etc. I was a little concerned about the noise because I think that was the main issue with renters. However, we didn't even notice it but we're deep sleepers. Maddy did provide a noise machine but we didn't even use it.

Lynda was a terrific host who gave me concise directions to her house and also volunteered herself to show me to her house. The room that I stayed at was really like the photographs I saw, or even better. Lots of bedsheets and pillows to sleep on and the room was quite cosy as well. There's a cupboard to hang clothes and a television, but I didn't watch TV there. The bathroom was superbly clean, with many towels of different sizes and needs and soaps if you need to use them. Just remember that the faucets operate by pulling them to turn on and pushing them to turn off. It was really a home away from home.

Lynda offered lots of maps and guides to me and also gave me some recommendations on where to eat and also where to see the sunset (Golden Gardens Park, near Ballard). The area she resides has lots of eateries, and her house is easily accessed by a bus from downtown. 

Lynda offered to make for me hot chocolate, and she provided me with an exotic kind which I liked. She offered fruits, bread, bagels, juice and more for breakfast which is more than enough for your stay. It's nice to sit in the kitchen or even out in the garden, to hear the nice songs of the birds, see the birds feed from the bird feeders and feel the summer breeze.

I had very wonderful conversations with her and even had conversations with her friends who came over for wine and food. Her son was here on my last day in Seattle and he was fine and asked if everything is fine.

It is an older home with the obvious worn edges and styling,  but again, it was so beautifully decorated and maintained that it just felt like home!  She was also very responsive to all of my questions. She was out of town during my stay, but she had a friend who met us and made arrival still easy and smooth. She doesn't charge a cleaning fee as she asks you to put all the dirty sheets and towels in a basket and clean any dishes you use, etc. but it was very easy and totally worth it. She was even able to let us keep the keys a bit longer so we could leave our luggage there on the last day so we could traipse around town without our luggage.

Check in and out process was super easy. The home is located in a nice residential neighborhood that's not too far of a drive away from the main touristy spots. Our allocated space in the basement was very nice. My mom took the bedroom while I used the pull-out sofa bed in the neighboring TV room - both were comfy. Our bathroom was very clean. I think the only drawback for some people (not me, though!) might be their 2 highly lovable cats. I loved their cats, but some ppl might not be into them - and while you can shoo the cats away, they sort of go where they want, and that includes the basement area (you can close the door to the bedroom, but if you're on the sofa bed like I was, they will jump up to cuddle :D).

The place looks exactly how it is listed definitely big enough to accommodate people, although there was no TV (they do say NO tv but I just didn't realize this til i got there, but honestly the only thing I would have used it for is watching football while my g/f was getting ready, we never really were at the apt for too long). I never met Erin & Nat that can be a positive or negative for different people - they certainly leave you alone and you never hear them, I on the other hand would like to meet the people that i am staying in their house only because i am a newbie on airbnb and just felt compelled to meet them haha. 

I tended to use Lyft and Uber to head around to the different areas, you can definitely use the bus, but i was only there a short weekend and it rained so didnt feel like dealing with that.  Every main area was a 10-15min drive away that we went to and we also explored Madison Valley.  

Provided shower towels, some great lotion, and an umbrella which was helpful.

One thing to keep in mind is the shower (which has a cute beard shower curtain) is for anyone who is lets say 6'0 and below.  I am about 5'7 and i was almost hitting the ceiling, as its a finished basement so it does  not necessarily have the highest ceiling.  

If you are visiting Seattle and have a car this place is definitely nice and a pleasant stay.  I wanted to walk as much as possible so the combination of the rain plus being in a valley was less than ideal for walking.  

Erin and Nat were VERY easy to get in touch with and communicate so that was certainly a plus on all fronts

The room itself is just as pictured: a very spacious room with a large desk, several plastic drawers, and an entire closet-worth of space. The guest bathroom is shared with the other guests staying at the house. It was never a problem because our showering schedules didn't overlap and the bathroom was always kept clean. Shampoo, body wash, towels, q-tips, and floss were provided for guest usage.

We were given the key and given the freedom to enter and exit the home as we pleased (at any time). Luyao is very trusting of her guests, and her only expectation is for guests to abide by basic home etiquette. We had access to certain appliances in the kitchen downstairs-- the coffeemaker, toaster,  and water boiler, which we did have the chance to take advantage of, but was definitely nice to have. The wifi is very fast and reliable, which made evening web-surfing very enjoyable.

Both Luyao and her husband Tao are quiet individuals who are very welcoming and open to new visitors. Our contact was kept to a minimal, since we were out most of the day, but they would open the door and say hello as we returned. My boyfriend and I keep to mostly keep to ourselves, so this arrangement worked very well for both parties. 

Parking was provided on the street, and the home itself was about 20 minutes away from downtown Seattle. The nearest drugstore, gas station, and foodplace is at most 5 minutes away.

I loved Seattle and it was very easy to get around that city. I did not have much of a budget for this trip so we decided to stay here, which was a low price point and have a friend sleep on the pull-out sofa. Even though I specifically requested Melissa provide enough towels and bedding to accommodate three people, the items were not there when we arrived.  Friday night we had to strip apart the bed to ensure our friend had a sheet for the couch. And the next morning, I used t-shirts as towels. She did deliver the items on Saturday but I was very frustrated that they were not there as previously asked. Her communication is not the best. I had asked if there was a place we could stash our luggage before we could check in. She did not confirm until 12 hours before our trip. It made it hard to plan. When I arrived, it was like she had no recollection of this previous arrangement and it took some doing to get in the building. I did appreciate that it worked out. Also, she claims it to be a quiet building. What she means is, you have to be very quiet because people in the unit next to you can hear your every move and you can hear their's.  I heard the man next to us chatting with his xbox and blasting Christian rock well into the night (well, he was probably playing it at a perfectly normal volume, but again, you can hear everything).  Also, this unit is on the bottom floor so you can absolutely hear people out on the street and every word of their conversation.  There are barely any amenities included in this unit. I had to buy hand soap and I left it there for the next tenant. Pu-rel is not hand soap. We also had to arrange specially to get an iron, but there was never an ironing board.

I enjoyed the city of Seattle very much. However, our short stay was met with abnormally hot weather. While I can usually tolerate mid-nineties weather, we were fairly uncomfortable throughout our stay due to the lack of air-conditioning within the home. When the weather dropped to cooler temperatures, we could open the windows but could not sleep due to the proximity of the home to the freeway (in front of the house). Even with the windows closed, we could hear the roars of every car as it zoomed by on the expressway. To compensate, we slept in the living room (the room furthest away from the noise source) until the traffic and the temperature were compromising (~3am).

The home would be fine during cooler months. I did like how the home looks and the beds were fairly comfy.

His place was just two blocks from my daughters apartment in the residential Wallingford area. It is withing walking distance of lots of great restaurants and shops.

I also enjoyed the Sutra Yoga studio which takes walk ins. To top it off the bus stop to downtown are easily accessed.

The bus ran right by the house which saved us some cab fare once we knew our way around a little.

I slept on the super comfy sofa-bed in the living room and was pleasantly surprised that you could close the room off completely with pocket door and french doors on each end.

It's not too far from downtown but also close to the arboretum, university, the Husky stadium and Seattle Children's Hospital, which is ideal for families visiting students, attending games or getting checkups. We had the downstairs all to ourselves with private entrance and fenced off patio area.

We had plenty of space to unwind, with a comfy bed, couch, work desk, rocking chair and reading nook. The kitchen and laundry room provided extra convenience.

After a very special night in Seattle for my brother's wedding, I came to Monika's ""Sweet Cabin"" where I was not greeted by key waiting for me as promised. After checking the door to see if it was unlocked as also instructed, an upset guest came out asking why I was trying to get in her room at 2AM. This was all very confusing considering I had made very specific arrangements with Monika a few days prior for my late night arrival. 

After contacting with Monika, she claimed that AirBNB double booked the room and that I needed to call them to sort it out. She claimed ""it has happened to several guests I've seen over the last 12-14 months."" 

It was very disappointing that she took zero responsibility for letting another guest stay in the room that I had booked a full week in advance, including having a number of correspondences with her as to when I would be arriving.

After 2 hours of trying to fix a giant mess of an issue that I had no responsibility of causing, I stayed at a Holiday Inn. AirBnB took charge for the mishap and refunded me fully. 

At the end of my correspondence with Monika, she told me to ""Go f**k yourself. You are banned from my house."" I was perfectly cordial throughout the ordeal leading up to this moment, so you would image I felt completely blind-sighted by this.

The apartment is very nice and spacious (especially for Seattle), well decorated and had benefits you don't often find in the area.  The bed is king size and was very comfortable.

The kitchen was well equipped and had everything you would need for cooking any meals.  The apartment was also equipped with a flat screen TV, full HD cable TV service, a DVR, internet, and a clothes washer and dryer.  The apartment comes with a dedicated parking space, which is a huge benefit in Ballard, as most people have to park on the street.

We never got to meet Jessica but her frequent messages and emails to us made her feel right there if we needed her. The cabin is behind 2 other homes and far enough from the street so that street noise in this quiet area is not an issue. Overall a perfect Airbnb experience at an very reasonable rate for a unit only 20 minutes from downtown Seattle by car.,Lots of towels in the bathroom and even adequate supplies of sundries,1

We got some delicious cheese and bread there. It's also fun to see them throw the fish. It's also near Capital Hill which can is a cool up and coming area that has live music. It's also not far from the space needle and the EMP Museum. We definitely recommend their place. The only challenge was finding a parking spot since its on street parking and there is construction going on which limits the amount of spots even more. Overall, a great experience!

The cottage is bright, cheery & very comfy. I enjoyed the singing birds & lush greenery all around.  They have a small patio outside the downstairs bedroom perfect for an afternoon break, (they have a small library of books & games also available at the ready), a little breakfast, lunch or as I preferred a cup of tea. A rocking chair made a nice addition to the patio!  Maps & Seattle booklets were also out & really helpful.

Their dogs were friendly and not bothersome at all, although I didn't come across them until my 3rd day. Their pets names were in the welcome material & in the cottage. I didn't see the cat.

I met Laura on day 2 & we had a nice visit in the garden. She recommended the botanical garden about 1/4 mile walk with lots of food spots nearby. She let me know ahead that they'd have a small group hanging about one evening & apologized for any extra noise.  Since I had other events all weekend, it wasn't an issue.

I liked having a coat rack near the front door. Light switches were easy to find as were the Wifi directions. Kitchen was stocked with the essential tools & cookware. There was extra bottled water in the fridge & teabags available.

The bathroom had extra towels handy & easy to understand directions for the washer/dryer combo. I appreciated having a hair dryer. 

The bedroom was large with two chairs & a handy table too. The closet space was ample.  Extra bedding & blankets were upstairs in an easy to reach spot. The bed was a bit creaky on one side but didn't hamper my slumber. 
The floors are wood & have the usual creaky settling sounds in a few places. It made for a warm, lived-in feel.
I would have liked a nightlight upstairs & downstairs so my cell phone flashlight wasn't needed & room lights could stay off.

Overall, I found the place to be not only quiet, but charming & a little retreat-retreat-like. I can't wait to stay again!

Warmest thanks Laura & Dale!

The lack of cable TV and no TV at all in the common area made for a very dull day with minimal in home entertainment. We also felt, for the price, the furnishings could be a little more updated.

Not only did we get a great view of the Lake, but we experienced the BEST Firework display from the backyard.

Alex left shampoo, soap, even a bottle of wine which was nice. The main problem was the lack of AC; unfortunately there was a heat wave in Seattle at the time and it made it quite uncomfortable at night. I'm sure it's fine most of the year. 

The main problem I have  with this set up is the use of a third party called (website hidden). I have been using (and hosting) Airbnb for years, and this was the first time I have used this system. It really is quite depersonalizing, and eliminates much of the draw of airbnb. There was a glitch in getting in the front door, and I had to phone a call center in order to get specific instructions, instead of calling Alex directly. In fact I never had Alex's cell number, even when I asked he didn't provide it.

We booked this fabulous townhouse with another couple for a family event in Seattle. It was a perfect place to mingle, share meals, and invite a few folks, while still having private space (BRs w/baths on first and third floors, separate entrance at first floor). 

Tall corner windows by the fireplace and TV (and in the master BR) overlooked the canal, harbor, passing ships, and sloping shores – a real piece of Seattle. But the truly panoramic view was from the rooftop patio (the “fourth level”) for morning coffee, evening cookouts, and sunsets over the distant mountains. Wow! The wet-bar/mini-fridge up there was a nice touch. 

At first glance it was just a dead-end street, but it was a good walkable location near Old Ballard. We crossed the bridge and watched boats pass thru the Chittenden Locks, walked Magnolia and Discovery Park, and ate at a friendly local place (Kiss Café).   

One downside – the nearby railroad tracks. Before booking, I asked about this. Philip frankly replied that he didn't mind the occasional passing trains but admitted the noise could be a problem at night. On arrival, there were bowls of what looked like mints next to each bed – tiny disposable earplugs! They did cut the sound and it wasn’t a real big issue for us, but it might be for some.

There were lots of nice little touches, from Trader Joe body products in the shower to an ironing board and iron to a TV with satellite channels to reliable wifi (which may not seem like a big deal, but as a Canadian without a data plan for this trip, it was much appreciated). 

The studio was located really close to a transit stop, so we were able to get anywhere we needed to go easily. Although we did a lot of sightseeing, we also had a lovely brunch at a restaurant called Bryant Corner, just around the corner from the studio. It was one of Jason and Susy's recommendations for Seattle dining spots from a handy list they left for us.

They went above and beyond to stock little treats for us, multiple methods of brewing local coffee, bikes, everything.

Julie was amazingly accommodating - letting us check in early and out late. She quickly responded to every question. A great host.

Information about Seattle along with things to do were also provided in the studio along with detailed instructions on how to do everything, like closing the windows and turning on the TV. They really thought of everything - our stay couldn't have gone more smoothly. The parking space in back made it easy for us to pull in and unload our stuff, and the neighborhood felt very safe and friendly. Overall, the space really made our Seattle trip perfect.

I experienced miscommunication with check-in instructions, but Marshall was responsive to our calls/texts/e-mails. Having access to the washing machine and dryer was very convenient, especially because our clothes smelled like food from all of the great restaurants in Seattle! We ran out of laundry detergent, and Marshall provided us with some within a couple of hours.

In addition, my group realized we forgot a blanket after we left Seattle, and Marshall quickly and kindly responded to our messages, and he sent the blanket back to us. Overall, Marshall was communicative and very accommodating!",The apartment was a quick 1015 minute drive to downtown,1
20516,370361,3449111,2013-01-31,2315832,Abbie,"We needed a 6-night stay at the last minute when other arrangements fell through on a trip to Seattle combining a family visit for the two of us and a professional conference for me. We needed a place with wi-fi and a private bathroom that would give me an easy-enough commute to and from downtown that would also be comfortable for my partner as a home base while I was out. Phew! Sheldon saved the day! 

His place is just as pictured and described. We really appreciated having both a clothes closet and a pantry/scullery closet. Sheldon clearly put good thought as well as good taste into appointing the room. The kitchenette is spare and little bit tight quarters next to the bed, but has everything you need. The full set of dishes includes two wine glasses and a bottle opener, and there is a dish tub with dish cloth, soap etc. in the pantry. The wi-fi is great, with outlets everywhere you need them, including a surge suppressor power strip beside the bed. Nice!

As others have said, Sheldon is a mellow and kind host. If you need anything, just ask. All we really missed was a bath mat, and a second full set of bath towels. We called Sheldon, and he brought a bath mat--and washed and replaced the towels for us not once but twice during our stay.

If you spend much time in the room during the day you may feel a bit in a fishbowl despite the privacy of the fence outside your entrance. Curtains instead of or in addition to the blinds on the glass entry door would help with this, I think. That said, the street is quiet, the furniture is all comfortable, and the room is beautiful. As everybody says, the bed is cushy-cozy and gave us wonderful sleep.

The neighborhood is terrific. We could always find parking on the street within 1/2-block of the door. There are all kinds of restaurants and shops in walking distance up and down Greenwood--and the public library, too. Ken's Market is a short walk south on Greenwood, and the PCC Co-op is a quick drive away on Aurora. We had a fabulous meal at Yanni's, and Diva Espresso is lovely. 

The #5 bus on Greenwood takes you to and from downtown in 20-25 minutes, taking you past Woodland Park Zoo and through Fremont on the way (don't miss Fremont while you're in Seattle!). Walk up to 85th and catch the #48 to the University District. It's also easy to get around by car from here.

Thanks again, Sheldon!",We could always find parking on the street within 12block of the door,1

49551,609701,22304272,2014-11-03,2442043,Diane,"This little cottage is delightful!   About the size of a hotel room, with everything you need.  Sweetly furnished with a collection of vintage prints and pottery, it is a welcoming, private and unique space.  The lush garden pathway in gives such a sense of quiet and remove from the city.   

Nan greeted us warmly in person and with a sign on the cottage with our names.  A nice touch.  We knew we could seek help with anything if needed, but the main house across the garden did not feel intrusive in any way.  

The bed was remarkable.  It was one thing I'd worried about as I love a very firm mattress.   It is described as soft in other reviews - and is, yet in such a way (memory foam topper) that I absolutely loved.  Big surprise for me.  We slept great and I even took naps to get some more.  The bedding was perfect for the season (flannel sheets) and down comforter with extra warmth as needed.   Honestly, I came home and missed 'my new bed'!

The bathroom is a bit unique - but having traveled in Europe and South America, the one open room for shower, sink and toilet was not a surprise.   Just took a bit more planning and a bit of wipe up after the shower.

The rain on the skylights was soothing.   The cruiser bikes were fun to ride several miles towards UW.  A little tricky to get the bikes out to the street through the path and narrow steps, but worth it!  Lots of great Seattle water action along the bike path ride.  Vibrant city!

The location is wonderful for exploring Fremont by foot or bike.  Easy to go a few blocks to everything.  Flying Apron Bakery and Cafe's vegan & gluten free pastries and savory soups, lasagna, etc. is incredible!   The Sunday market was fun.   Coffee shops welcome and you can linger for hours.  The general location is central to everything Seattle,  Discovery Park not far, the Ballard Locks, Woodland Park, Ballard district, Greenlake, UW, downtown...all an easy drive without freeway if desired.  

As our daughter lives nearby in Ballard, we'll be making this our Seattle nest many times as the years go by.

The other room had a very comfortable bed. No AC, but the fans and open windows cooled it down comfortably. It's clearly a vacation rental - not someone's personal apartment. The windows look into the alley - and there was typical city noise. It was an easy 10-15 minute walk to Pike's place in one direction, and the stadium in the other. Homeless in the area are plentiful and can get a bit aggressive, but it is the city. We parked on the street at night and in the garage across the street during the day and just walked everywhere.

18720,3889050,46514608,2015-09-11,30982215,Ohad,"I'll start with the good: the atmosphere was really nice. People were friendly and welcoming, and there was a genuine feeling of community amongst the residents.

Now for the bad:

First of all I must state that it seems I stayed at the place when lots of renovation was happening. I'm hoping this is not the norm, so your mileage may vary...
I was in a 2 person room on the bottom floor. The shower was being renovated (thus non-existing), so the closest shower was one floor up, shared by the residents of both floors. The renovations were not stated in the listing.
My room was adjacent to the work, thus it was impossible to sleep in, since noisy construction started early in the morning. The construction noise also meant that most people preferred to leave the house in order to get some work done. In the room there was an exposed water pipe, and very loud dripping noise started every time that pipe was used. The room had no ""luxuries"" like a hook to hang my wet towel on.

During my stay the entire house lost water for two days. Walking 20 minutes in the morning (to my workplace) just to brush my teeth and take a shower was not a pleasant experience. I can see how this sort of thing can happen, and the host was very gracious about it, trying to find solutions for the residents. Normally I would not comment about such an unforeseen event, but along with the rest of the renovation, this was a bit too much. We were promised a refund for the 2 days, I'm still waiting for mine.

I can see how this place can be great if no renovation is taking place. I think the host should have either shut-down during the renovation, or at least make it explicit in the listing.

Giving it 3 starts, as an average between my 1 star experience and the 5 starts it could have been.

When I left, they just started tearing apart the upstairs kitchen...",I can see how this sort of thing can happen and the host was very gracious about it trying to find solutions for the residents,1

I loved Seattle and it was very easy to get around that city. I did not have much of a budget for this trip so we decided to stay here, which was a low price point and have a friend sleep on the pull-out sofa. Even though I specifically requested Melissa provide enough towels and bedding to accommodate three people, the items were not there when we arrived.  Friday night we had to strip apart the bed to ensure our friend had a sheet for the couch. And the next morning, I used t-shirts as towels. She did deliver the items on Saturday but I was very frustrated that they were not there as previously asked. Her communication is not the best. I had asked if there was a place we could stash our luggage before we could check in. She did not confirm until 12 hours before our trip. It made it hard to plan. When I arrived, it was like she had no recollection of this previous arrangement and it took some doing to get in the building. I did appreciate that it worked out. Also, she claims it to be a quiet building. What she means is, you have to be very quiet because people in the unit next to you can hear your every move and you can hear their's.  I heard the man next to us chatting with his xbox and blasting Christian rock well into the night (well, he was probably playing it at a perfectly normal volume, but again, you can hear everything).  Also, this unit is on the bottom floor so you can absolutely hear people out on the street and every word of their conversation.  There are barely any amenities included in this unit.

47802,6108796,45570782,2015-09-04,36944475,Louise,"Pros: Christine was very quick to respond and very helpful, on site parking, close by frequent bus to downtown, immaculately clean flat, good storage space, comfortable bed and powerful shower, extras in the kitchen (such as herbs, milk and coffee). A beautiful flat. 

Cons: the noise from the road if you're very sensitive to this and unused to traffic noise. It isn't a major road though, more of a slipway and we personally didn't find it affected us at night and we were out in the day. 

I would agree with a previous reviewer that it would be helpful if the directions were updated to show the diversion to Aurora Avenue/route 99. We didn't have GPS, only a map and it took us 45 minutes from leaving the i5 to find the flat. That may partly have been as we arrived in the dark. If you intend on doing that I would use Google street map to get clear in your mind what the Hudson looks like and how far along it is so that you spot it first time. 

To get the bus downtown, you go via the main lobby into the outside space, down the steps to the right through the small 'park' and onto Dexter where the bus stop is immediately there. The 26/28 run frequently and will stop at Pike Place/3rd Avenue.

I would highly recommend this lodging to anyone who is looking for budget accommodations in the city. The location was ideal for my visit, as it was central to the nightlife and entertainment district of Capital Hill. The room itself was small and spartan, with a twin bed (Room 1). Other rooms had larger beds. I think there is enough room to upgrade to a queen or at least a double. 4 rooms share 2 bathrooms and a full kitchen. Everything was quite clean.

This is a spiritual center, so you have to keep an open mind and be respectful. Paul, the host, explained all of this in a very detailed welcome message. It's very self-service - I never even met the host. Received a door code via email prior to arrival, and did not see another person there for the first 48 hours. Altogether it was a great stay.

We were told about AirBnB from a friend and thought, ""why not?"". This was going to be our first experience for using the site, so we began our perusal of options for Seattle. Looking through everything availible, I came across Jill &Jerome's "" quaint apt"" and realized it was perfect for us. I sent the message out to book, and Jill responded within a few short hours. She made sure to keep an open line of communication from beginning, with the booking and all the way thru to the morning we left. Once Shana and I arrived in the city, Jill let us know she wouldn't be home at the time of our arrival but be back at a later point if we needed anything. As per the directions we were given, we entered the apartment and were shocked.  Jill & Jerome made sure to have anything you would think to need while traveling. There was an overwhelming sense of home and that is hard to come by, let alone try to fake. The location of the apartment is in perfect walking distance from a slice of Historic Colombia City. It holds a little bit of everything from the restaurants, to a great art house theater. It makes exploring worth it. Shana and I had a chance to speak to Jill, and found out that it was their first experience being a host on AirBnB. I was amazed to hear it because she seemed to be a season pro, and that earns double the thumbs up from me. All and all I will always recommend Jill & Jerome to anyone looking for a place to call home whilst traveling in Seattle. I wouldn't hesitate to stay with them again!

The area itself was big enough but it was not completely private. Once down the narrow dark stairway, you enter a utility area which includes the furnace, hot water tank, and laundry area. None of this is shown in the pictures. We had to use the flashlight on our phone to navigate our way through the pitch black until we could find a light around the corner. There was a note that indicated the owners wouldn't come down except to do laundry. Again, this wasn't mentioned in the ad. They never actually came down but we spent the 4 nights on edge that they might appear without warning. This was especially uncomfortable as the laundry is directly next to the bathroom. 
 
 The parking situation was probably the most frustrating. There was room in front of the house for 2 cars as well as a large enough driveway. Unfortunately someone purposely parked their vehicle across both spots on the road. We also weren't permitted to park in the driveway (which remained empty for almost the entire 4 days). Because of this we were forced to park down the street in a questionable neighborhood. 

  The neighborhood itself wasn't the worst place ever but it was definitely sketchy. The first sign of this was when I almost stepped on a used condom directly in front of the house. The funny thing about a used condom is nobody is going to clean it up so it remained there for the entire 4 days. This is obviously out of Kelly's control but again I'm just being honest. Very close to the I-5 and you could get almost anywhere in Seattle within 10-20 minutes. Also, an Uber cab was only $10 to downtown. We did avoid public transit because we felt it could be a little sketchy at night. 

Kelly and her roommate were quick to respond to our texts. Other than that there was no direct interaction with either of them which was fine by us. 

On a positive note, the bed was decently comfortable, the shower was great and as mentioned, the proximity to downtown was great. Also, when you consider most hotels downtown are around $300 a night in summer, you're getting a great deal at $80.

She is a superhost for a reason.  First of all, she let us stay there on short notice after our previous reservation was cancelled. She invited us in and made us feel like old friends. The house is in great shape and is very much designed around its Airbnb visitors. It's easy to tell that a lot of thought was put into making it a pleasant stay for guests.

As first time visitors to Seattle it made a huge difference having someone point us to the right places to go for sight seeing and public transportation. Her generosity with her time was so appreciated and valuable. The location of the house is ideal for people who are trying to avoid renting a car. Public transportation is just a few blocks away and the Seattle Center is very close. From there you can pretty much explore the whole city. Her house is in a very nice neighborhood. We felt safe walking home at night. We slept on an incredibly comfortable bed with the windows up and were never once bothered by outside noise. The Wi-Fi in her house is very fast. I will definitely stay here again.",Her house is in a very nice neighborhood,1

It's a pretty bare minimum unit, but great for those who are not looking for much during their stay. If you're focused on being out and about then this place will do the trick. 

The location is PRIME in terms of getting around all over mayor parts of Seattle primarily by foot. Could not have picked a better location for that. If you visit here, be sure to walk around the neighborhood you're in, as there are some amazing small restaurants, bars, coffee houses.

The place is a lot older than you may think as it's in a pretty classic Seattle neighborhood. The place overall could use a few touch ups in the bathroom/shower to really make it ""cozy"".

When we first arrived we we’re not sure what door to knock on, so we went towards the back as we had mentioned checking in at 3. Maria was a feeling a bit under the weather, but was super nice and helpful, gave us a quick tour, showed us where the cold beers and snacks were and that was the end of our interaction while there (which was totally cool with us).

The place is very nice and clean. The entry way has a nice table to sit and drink a cup of coffee. But I think the upstairs is the gem of this place. Very well lit, and it has a nice closet and plenty of space. There is no AC and we were there in probably the hottest day in Seattle, but just the windows open, really air the room and keep it really cool. There is a park pretty much across the street some on a weekend you hear some people/kids playing, and there was a concert at the park or something one of the nights but it wasn’t bad. Whlist the bedrooms and the entry are great, the bathroom and sitting/dresing room are really shallow, the ceilings are really low. I am 6’2” and I think the highest point of these might be 6’3”… the bathroom is small but very functional, if you are below 5’9” you might not feel at cramped.

The location allowed me to the bus to anywhere in town I wanted to go. It is quiet and you can enter from the side street and not even go past the house. I not only will stay here again when I come back to Seattle, but I'm looking for reasons to return again soon.

There is a small coffee bar about two blocks away, plus an Italian and a pizza restaurant, but I didn't get a chance to try them. If you're looking for breakfast or other restaurants, they're about a 15 minute walk away. 

The North Capitol Hill neighborhood is lovely. Do walk around and look at the homes and the landscaping. Here are two suggestions:

Walk east on Boston St. and stay left where the main road bends right and becomes 15th. Continue around the E Boston Terrace loop and check out the modernist and other homes, and the beautiful views. When you're done, you can continue south on 15th to Volunteer Park and the Seattle Asian Art Museum, or a bit further down 15th to find restaurants and shops.

Next: from the studio, walk west on Boston and south on 10th to E Blaine St. Go down the steps on the east side of 10th and visit Streissguth Gardens. You'll find an entry stone and a small kiosk with pamphlets partway down the stairs. 

If you're relying on public transportation, you can (and should) buy an Orca card. The card costs $5 but the convenience is worth it. If you're coming in from the airport, you can buy one at the Sea-Tac light rail station. Load it with some money and never worry about having exact change for the bus. In town, they're sold at QFC and Safeway grocery stores. Just tap and go, and never worry about having exact change.

If you have a smartphone, download the OneBusAway app and always know where the bus stops are and when the next bus will arrive. Very handy!",The card costs 5 but the convenience is worth it,0

My girlfriend and I spent 3 days in Seattle and stayed at Sid's condo.  This place is just cool.  The building is clearly brand new and the amenities are sweet.  There's a gym, game lobby, and a gorgeous roof terrace overlooking the city....and that's before you even enter the condo itself.  

Sid's place is modern yet comfortable.  It is very clean and only about a 10 minute walk to Pike Place Market.  Also, there's a great restaurant/bar attached to the building that has some killer Moscow Mules (only $5 from 4-7 and 10-12 M - F).  

Sid was very responsive and his instructions were clear and easy to understand.  

Restaurant Recommendations:  Rocco's just around the corner on 2nd ave., Top Pot on Blanchard and 5th Ave for doughnuts (Obama's eaten here - good or bad thing depending on your preferences), and El Borracho near Pike Place Market ($1-$2 tiny tacos and $4 margaritas.  Try the Carnitas and the $2 Steak taco..yum).

He was happy to answer my questions and also give me privacy. I had great conversation with him and a friend of his as well. The room itself is lovely, clean and serene. The bed was dreamily comfy - I was in danger of missing out on Seattle in favor of sleeping in!Do note that the room is located across the hall from another Airbnb room, so there may be up to 4-5 people in the house at a time and you will be sharing a bathroom with the other renter (however not with Jon). This was not an issue for me, and I also had a nice talk with the couple who rented the other room. The last two nights of my stay, the room was empty. Jon also went above and beyond by providing several toiletries during my stay.

Since it was my first time in Seattle, I was hesitant about the parking/driving/location situation, so I'll comment on that for others wondering the same. My first night, I found nearby parking on a side street and left my car there for 4 days with no issue. Jon's place shares a pull-in carport so I was able to unload and load my luggage there before parking, which helped a lot. The house seems to be in an up-and-coming neighborhood, which has its ups and downs. I wasn't sure if it was safe to walk at night alone, so I stuck with Uber after dark (never more than $5-10). I'm a single female traveler with little-to-no knowledge of Seattle, so that may be why. As for downtown/Pike Place Market, it was a fairly easy walk of about 45 minutes and that worked great for me in the mornings because it gave me a chance to see the city. I found it affordable to Uber anywhere I didn't feel like walking and I could've driven my car too if I were more comfortable with city parking. There are things to do in the Central District neighborhood I think, but I mostly ventured outside of it. Capitol Hill is a popular neighborhood nearby too.

I think Jon's place is best for travelers open to getting to know their housemates but who also want a quiet place to rest in the evenings.

Then it was back to that fabulous bedstead into which I snuggled for a night's good rest. Not before reading a chapter or two by the lamp light perched in just the right place.

Some people on AirBNB have mentioned that the room was too ""warm"" for them. The day we checked in was one of the hottest on record in Seattle and I'm pretty heat sensitive, so I had my concerns. But I didn't find the temperature to be an issue at all. There's a huge industrial door in the back and industrial fan which you can open up if you need a cool breeze. And the fans by the bed were great.

The bed itself was also super comfortable, and we had the best night's sleep we had during our whole stay in Seattle.

Pros: Great location; lovely, sunny deck with great view and a hot tub; Jeanette & Ian are communicative and low-stress hosts.

Cons: Small downstairs unit with an awkward layout - not the best for privacy or luxury atmosphere; issues with water pressure (maybe because we were using the washing machine at the same time?); on a busy street, so the main floor bedrooms were loud.

Overall: I recommend this place for a large group of people on a budget, who did not care about having luxury accommodations. The house is clean, and the main floor is spacious enough to have everyone hang out up there. But, if you're looking for a fancy party pad, this is not it.

When the cleaner came at 9:55 she saw 10 girls outside the house and assumed we had all spent the night. With us, the cleaner was super nice and apologized for being a bit early but then lied and said we checked out late.

* Location: The apartment is truly in the heart of Belltown, a great and lively neighborhood with lots to do. Also, it's very close to downtown (Pike Place market, etc.).
* Functional: It's a full apartment (kitchen, bath, bedroom, etc.), so you can get all your normal home-stuff done.
* Windows: Belltown, and 4th ave in particular, can be lively / noisy. The windows are super insane noise-shielders. When they're closed, you have no idea there's anyone out there.
* Decor: The apartment has personality!
* Host: Aaron is a greta host. He responds to questions immediately and clearly. He responded to basic service requests (e.g.: ironing board) very quickly. Check-in and check-out were quick and efficient.
* WiFi: Top-notch: Fast and reliable!
* Coffee: The apartment offers excellent coffee & coffee maker. Much appreciated :)

Cons:
* Size: It's a small apartment (studio). Best if you're spending most of your time out in the city.
* Amenities: The apartment lacks AC and TV (if that's your thing).",Checkin and checkout were quick and efficient,1

The neighborhood was perfect for everything that we wanted to, site seeing at the city center, geocaching in Ballard and close to the reason we came to Seattle.  For the hours that we kept it was nice that we did not have to go through the house.  We had an issue with the bathroom light fuse but a quick text took care of that.  We should have asked for another set of towels as there isn't a place to really let them dry out during the day, but that is our own fault because Jean-Marc did say to just ask if we need anything.  The one complaint we do have is that there is no place to put luggage out of the way.  It was either on the bed or on the floor.  The fan cooled the room down quickly at night.  There is tons of parking and it was very well lit at night.  We felt comfortable leaving our vehicle parked all day while we geocached with friends.

The cottage is bright, cheery & very comfy. I enjoyed the singing birds & lush greenery all around.  They have a small patio outside the downstairs bedroom perfect for an afternoon break, (they have a small library of books & games also available at the ready), a little breakfast, lunch or as I preferred a cup of tea. A rocking chair made a nice addition to the patio!  Maps & Seattle booklets were also out & really helpful.

Their dogs were friendly and not bothersome at all, although I didn't come across them until my 3rd day. Their pets names were in the welcome material & in the cottage. I didn't see the cat.

I met Laura on day 2 & we had a nice visit in the garden. She recommended the botanical garden about 1/4 mile walk with lots of food spots nearby. She let me know ahead that they'd have a small group hanging about one evening & apologized for any extra noise.  Since I had other events all weekend, it wasn't an issue.

I liked having a coat rack near the front door. Light switches were easy to find as were the Wifi directions. Kitchen was stocked with the essential tools & cookware. There was extra bottled water in the fridge & teabags available.

The bathroom had extra towels handy & easy to understand directions for the washer/dryer combo. I appreciated having a hair dryer. 

The bedroom was large with two chairs & a handy table too. The closet space was ample.  Extra bedding & blankets were upstairs in an easy to reach spot. The bed was a bit creaky on one side but didn't hamper my slumber. 
The floors are wood & have the usual creaky settling sounds in a few places. It made for a warm, lived-in feel.
I would have liked a nightlight upstairs & downstairs so my cell phone flashlight wasn't needed & room lights could stay off.

Overall, I found the place to be not only quiet, but charming & a little retreat-retreat-like. I can't wait to stay again!

Warmest thanks Laura & Dale!

76231,2593263,17644693,2014-08-15,6865977,Erick,"My girlfriend and I stayed here for 3 nights in August. It was our first Airbnb experience and overall I thought it was a great decision. Paul, the host responded quickly to our initial request and accepted us newbies within a couple of days. He emailed us with information about checking in and the house rules as well as directions from SeaTac and to local hangouts.

Our arrival went smoothly. We never met our host as he was out of town, but instructions were laid out as to where everything was in the house. There are 4 guest rooms in the house sharing 2 bathrooms.  The building is also used as a meeting place for a spiritual group but it wasn't being used the days we stayed there and we never saw anyone there for that purpose. I saw one of the other guests a couple of times and my partner met the occupants of the other rooms on their way out for the morning. I would describe the experience as almost fully private, especially if you don't expect to use the communal kitchen.

Bathroom:
The house is definitely older. The upstairs bathroom seems original to the house. The stand-up in-tub shower was a little awkward to work with but much more efficient than trying to kneel under the super low shower head of the downstairs bathroom. 

I tried to look up the information regarding the definition of ""Essentials"" and I didn't really get any information on Airbnb's website. Regardless there were ample towels, hand and face cloths and a supply of shampoo and body wash. There was also a hairdryer. I looked around briefly for an iron and ironing board but did not find one.

Bedroom:
We were in Room 2. It had a double bed with 4 pillows. Also in the room was a desk, luggage rack, a dresser hidden in one of the two closets, a chair, ample lightning, and 2 fans which were much appreciated considering it was 30 degrees Celsius the day we arrived. It also has two large windows that look down to the street. The door locks.  I had 3 pretty decent nights' sleep considering I've never slept in a shared double in more than a decade.

Shared spaces:
I didn't use the kitchen. There seemed like a lot of areas of the house that I shouldn't explore so I didn't. I wanted to catch a bit of a ball game I was following along with on my phone but noticed there was no ""living room"" of sorts.  We spent almost every non-sleeping/non-showering moment out on the town so it wasn't an issue.

Overall experience:
Great first Airbnb experience. In terms of value at this time of the year, amazing. So glad we stayed here. Lots of great bars in the neighborhood. Wifi!!!! Would I stay here again? Yes.

The other woman Tina, and her co-worker women at Seattle were helpful, and they ensured we find the parking. Chris should be more polite to people who are giving him business.

Lara had the front steps up to the loft lit up which was super beautiful. The loft was very accurately described; super small but cozy and perfect for a one to two night stay if you are planning ons pending most of your trip out and about. Even though the place was tiny (still accurately described) it was well decorated and homey. We really enjoyed our cozy night there. FYI on google maps it looks as if their place is on the corner lot.... It is NOT the corner lot. We may have trekked in to the neighbors yard a little before realizing our mistake. Totally our bad, make sure to check the house numbers! The only reason we are giving it a 4/5 is because its not a full apartment (no real door to the bathroom, no real worries), but for what this place is its a GREAT place to stay and we wish Lara could be our host with every Airbnb experience!

The place looks exactly how it is listed definitely big enough to accommodate people, although there was no TV (they do say NO tv but I just didn't realize this til i got there, but honestly the only thing I would have used it for is watching football while my g/f was getting ready, we never really were at the apt for too long). I never met Erin & Nat that can be a positive or negative for different people - they certainly leave you alone and you never hear them, I on the other hand would like to meet the people that i am staying in their house only because i am a newbie on airbnb and just felt compelled to meet them haha. 

I tended to use Lyft and Uber to head around to the different areas, you can definitely use the bus, but i was only there a short weekend and it rained so didnt feel like dealing with that.  Every main area was a 10-15min drive away that we went to and we also explored Madison Valley.  

Provided shower towels, some great lotion, and an umbrella which was helpful.

One thing to keep in mind is the shower (which has a cute beard shower curtain) is for anyone who is lets say 6'0 and below.  I am about 5'7 and i was almost hitting the ceiling, as its a finished basement so it does  not necessarily have the highest ceiling.  

If you are visiting Seattle and have a car this place is definitely nice and a pleasant stay.  I wanted to walk as much as possible so the combination of the rain plus being in a valley was less than ideal for walking.  

Erin and Nat were VERY easy to get in touch with and communicate so that was certainly a plus on all fronts

She kept in touch with us our whole way up from Portland and Seattle, and helped us coordinate our arrival via public transit, which was very helpful since we had been travelling for the past few days. When we arrived, it was close to a tree house paradise with big windows overlooking her garden and foilage. The place was set up very cozily and we felt right at home. Yvonne and Ralph were very accommodating to both of our needs, when we asked if there was firewood, they jumped up and grabbed some for us and even set up the fire for us so we didn't have to bother, which led us to a cozy and romantic evening. Ralph appears to be a master craftsman (he built an awesome fence in a day) and fire builder. The place also has a full kitchen with just about all you need to cook (and drinks to boot!), and we enjoyed a delicious meal with items we purchased from the Pike Place market.

The apartment is pretty much as pictured.  The kitchen does have a few pots and pans if you need/want to cook something--but no spices, so bring those with you!  All the appliances were clean and worked perfectly.  One of the bedrooms has a large attached bathroom with a full tub.  The other room is separate from the second bath, and you have to walk past the master bedroom to get to the bath.  This didn't bother us; I mention it only because it isn't the most private 2-bedroom layout you've likely seen and if you're not comfortable with that you might want to look for one of the Alfreds properties that has a different layout.
The location can't be beat!  This is in Harbor Steps at University and First (the map on AirBnB wasn't plotting it correctly when I booked).  So, it is just a couple blocks to Pike's Market, the Target is only 3 blocks, and the Kress Supermarket is just one block further.  
The apartment is very comfortable, and I would stay here again.  The one thing to note is that the carpet in the entry way really needs a deep cleaning or needs to be replaced... so much so that I wasn't sure the place had been cleaned when we walked in... but the rest of the apartment was just fine and very clean.

It felt bigger than it looked because there's a hallway attached, and it has a huge closet and storage for your clothes. You can put away your suitcase and it feels like home. 

It was decorated really nicely. The kitchen was small, but stocked with everything you could need. Since it's in such a fun area we were rarely home, but we would have been comfortable cooking and eating dinner, and even having friends over for drinks. It doesn't feel like a hotel, but it also doesn't feel like someone else's apartment; it's really cozy and sweet. 

The location is great for walking to nightlife in Capitol Hill, and it's only about a 15-minute walk downtown to all of the big stores. We loved the sandwich shop and brunch spot/bar downstairs. Both had great food and no wait. There are some fun restaurants and great venues just a few blocks away; we walked during the day and took a very short cab ride at night.  

It's in a big residential building with a grocery store across the street. The big back patio would be nice in the summer. 

Lastly, don't forget to get some of Seattle's famous late-night hot dogs just up the street on Harvard. They are to-die-for, and this was in a perfect location to indulge!

I'm listing the drawbacks below, in case you have different needs than ours. I would definitely book this place again, but I can see a few of these things taking away from someone else's experience: 
1. The water never got much above body temperature, so our showers were short. 
2. The bathroom vanity is super small with no storage, so it was difficult to plug in a curling iron and store our toiletries. We had to keep them in the closet and move them back and forth the entire time. 
3. Don't bother getting the parking permit. The lot never fills up, and it's actually much less expensive to pay for parking than to pay for the permit.  
4. The heat is really hard to control. It's either on full blast or not at all. We ended up leaving it on but sleeping with the windows wide open. 
5. The sidewalk across the street is a gathering place for homeless people. The neighborhood feels VERY safe and its very nice, but there doesn't seem to be an effort to keep drunk or stoned people quiet or off the street. A few times we were woken up by loud yelling, but it never felt unsafe. It was just a little annoying.",Its in a big residential building with a grocery store across the street,1

She was such a kind and loving host, we had some great conversations and a cuppa with her whilst discussing travel and Australia and  have hopefully become friends for life.

I couldn't recommended staying anywhere else, this stay was idyllic and such a great overall experience of Seattle.

What we did not love was the absence of wifi, the steep steps up to the apt (we are seniors!) and the difficult parking lot which became quite jammed up on Saturday night.  The Union Bar on the street below was great with a great youngish crowd - definitely an asset to have a beer or eat.  Besides the parking lot issue, the street the apartment is on is not the best and may make some people uncomfortable.

A really short drive to downtown Seattle, but peaceful and removed from the insanity of it. Also close driving distance to the Fremont/Ballard neighborhoods! Street parking out in front is hassle free and convenient. Really loved the tiny microhood feel. Within walking distance is an eatery/grocery store called the Icebox that featured amazing breakfast specials (the waffles were wonderful)!

Capitol Hill is just as she described: progressive, artistic, vibrant. There are a ton of places to eat and have drinks just steps away from her apartment, but we also easily walked downtown to Pikes Market, Pioneer Square, and Belltown. 

If you choose to take care of her cats, they are very sweet cats. They will come sleep with you, even if it is a warm night :) They did wake us up pretty early in the morning to eat, but once they are fed they settle back down.

I came from Denver to Seattle in early October and had a long commute from my brother's house while our house was being finalized in mid December.  I realized I needed to stay in Seattle to be closer to work before our move.  I am very lucky that I found Misty's place as it was absolutely perfect.  Charming, cozy, super clean, comfy and spacious.  Plus the location is terrific within a safe and quiet neighborhood that is close to great little shops and dining options.  

I stayed for almost 3 weeks, at her place, while my husband was in Denver packing up things for his trek to Seattle to meet up with me.  It was hard being away from him however having such a nice place to come home to after work made it much better.  

I would highly recommend this location to visitors or people looking to move to Seattle.  The location is also simple to find  and an easy drive to downtown and near other hot spots within the Emerald City.  

Misty has wonderful taste in her décor and some nice amenities to her little getaway including: tranquil bedroom that is spacious, big closet, gorgeous bathroom with claw foot tub, warm and cheerful living/den area with Keurig, mini fridge, microwave and washer dryer.

He also was kind enough to provide an air mattress and sheets for our daughter. The unit is spacious and we loved the old architecture. It was hot the day we arrived and there is no a/c, but it worked out for us because we didn't come home from sight seeing until late. We had to have all the windows open due to heat, which made it very loud inside the unit due to proximity to the highway. It was much louder than I'd anticipated, but amazingly it didn't bother us at all. It was so constant that it was almost like ocean waves while we slept, although trying to talk with each other in the morning was difficult unless we within close proximity to one another.

He was very kind and offered to carry some luggage for us to the 3rd floor. The apartment was very nice. The only downside to the stay was the noise outside. This is to be expected though when you stay downtown. A lot of early morning trash trucks in the alley, random people, and birds. The club music next door can be heard through the walls too. We did split the room, so my experience comes from sleeping in the living room on the pullout bed. Whereas the other couple we traveled with said most of the noise was muffled or rarely heard in the bedroom. We had a great stay though as the noise is tolerable. Again, it comes with the location. The check out process was really easy and everyone was very accommodating. Our flight was in the evening, but we were allowed to leave our luggage in the bar after check out and stroll the city.

The information we had when we came in (where the suite was, restaurant recommendations, house rules, etc.) was very clear and well displayed.  The suite was just as described.  I was traveling with my brother, so they had the 2nd room with a futon set up for us on our arrival.  When we told people where we were staying we got a lot of comments like ""I don't want to have to stay somewhere where I have to have a conversation with someone"", ""I don't want to have other people around an bugging me all the time"".  Let me just say that this is NOT how Kate and Danny operate.  They touched base a couple times throughout the stay to make sure everything was okay, but they weren't dropping in all the time ""bugging"" us.  They also made it clear that they were around for any questions/recommendations.  We had our week packed full of stuff and were really only at the house to sleep, so we had to ""set up"" a time on the last day of our stay just to ""meet"" the people who provided this amazing house.  When you stay in a hotel you risk getting a room near an elevator, or with loud people above you.  You won't have this problem here.  Don't get me wrong, from time to time you will hear them walking above you, but couldn't hear anything else.  It was very quiet and peaceful.  Kate and Danny thought of everything to make the stay great.  They provided basic toiletries and a blow dryer, they had a mini fridge and microwave, city guides in the rooms, water, granola bars, fruit, tea, coffee.  It was all very well thought out.  The 2 rooms and bathroom were very spacious and clean and just as advertised.  Parking was always available on the street right in front of the house.  I would absolutely recommend staying here.  It was nice and close to downtown Seattle (15-20 min drive max for us even in traffic), easy access to I-5, a lot of cute restaurants in the area.  Thanks so much for opening your beautiful home to us Kate and Danny!",Our experience was great,1

56358,1980395,46140587,2015-09-08,13673320,Bill,"Apart from a very nice welcome letter, we never heard from or saw Jane or Roey, but that was OK since we did little at their place besides sleep.  We didn't cook, so I can't comment on the kitchen equipment except to say that there is both a coffee pot and something you can use to make tea, neither of which we used.  (There is a nice espresso shop just down the street, which is where we got our caffeine).  The inside of the town house is pleasant, nicely furnished, and largely as described/shown on the website, although you have to wait until you get there to learn that there is no air conditioning (which fortunately we didn't need) and that the heat in the front room is broken, so you have to use the gas fireplace.  The furnishings most important to us -- the sheets, towels and bed -- were all very nice.  However, the master bedroom would be improved by a chest of drawers, and there were nowhere near enough hangers for 4 people.  Also, while there is a TV in the master bedroom, it is not connected to anything other than a DVD player.  Strange. that.  But overall, the place was pleasant, very clean and comfortable.

The one problem -- and it is a big one -- is access.  I could not recommend this to anyone who will be arriving after dark or is driving anything much bigger than a Fiat 500.  And a back-up camera is an absolute MUST.  The place is completely unmarked and invisible from the road at night.  The whole compound is surrounded by a 6-foot solid wood fence, and the entrance to the complex is an alley that looks like a dead end when you pull in.  We pulled into that alley twice and then backed out thinking this could not possibly be the right place.  Only on the third try did we pull all the way up to the fence and found that there was a right turn you have to make to get in and then a left turn before you catch your first glimpse of a house number.  And then, the next morning, you realize that the alley/driveway is far too narrow to turn around in, so you have to back out through those two narrow turns.  We would have parked on the street, but could never find an empty space.  There is a garage of sorts, but again, it is too small for anything larger than a Fiat 500.  We were driving a Chrysler 200 -- hardly he biggest car in the world -- and once we got that into the garage, we  couldn't open the driver's door enough to get out without climbing across the console.  We parked outside for the entire 4 days.  

Because of the access issues, I can only give the place 2 stars.  Apart from that, I would probably give it 4.",We would have parked on the street but could never find an empty space,-1

Upon booking my stay there was minimal communication between me and Melissa. I got the overall impression that she didn't really care. I asked her where I could find the keys and she said ""should be on table or kitchen counter"". Lot's of one liners. She did not give me details about the area I would be staying in and she didn't provide much help or ask me if I had been to Seattle before (which I hadn't).

I was very surprised when my Uber driver dropped me off at the apartment complex. It was very run down and ugly. There was dirt and debris in the corners of the complex, the floor had cracks and there was a big industrial sized trash can with rust stains right at the entrance of the complex towards the back wall.

I walked into the apartment and it was subpar. The pictures make it look much nicer than it is. Upon inspection I noticed that the blinds were a bit crooked and the window had water stains. There was a big dent in the floor right before the kitchen entrance (you sink down when you step on it). The soap in the sink was almost empty and the sponge was old and used. The windows were dirty, the toilet moves. So if you're sitting on the toilet and try to shift your weight the entire thing moves... Also, the bathtub had soap scum stains which she blamed on a botched paint job???

The bedroom was actually nicer than the rest of the place but it is very tiny. You feel boxed in.

Melissa did allow me and my guest to check in early at around 9:30 AM which was nice and she did offer to wave the $30 per extra guest fee. She did call me on the last day and ask me how my stay was and I clearly stated that it was a lot worse than I expected.

Overall I felt tricked by the pictures and the place just looks seedy. Sorry Melissa but this is true and you have to clean the place up because it's not fair to other guests.

Although she was friendly, the young woman was not able to provide info on things such as how to get around or places to eat.  The area is pretty isolated it seems as it is in an industrial area. I suggest that maybe a guest book with bus or metrolink info as well as places to eat nearby be provided for guests.  On to the accommodations.  Being that so many people gave such high ratings, my expectations were high.  I hate to say it but I was disappointed. The place is unbearably HOT!!. Might be a good thing in winter but our stay was in summer.  Had to sleep with the fan blowing in my face all night to be remotely comfortable.  Especially upstairs where the beds are. The room is interesting but is in need of some updating.  One bed is just a mattress on the floor and the other has an extremely soft mattress.  Our heavy material at the windows fell at some point since they were not really drapes but just clipped up at the window.  This place has potential but needs some attention to detail.  Having access to an iron to take the wrinkles out of our clothes once we unpacked would have been nice.  On the good note, bathrooms are very nice and having the body scrubs were a nice touch.  Mary was also very accommodating in allowing up to stay way past check out since we had a late flight and the spa is closed on Monday. And it is nice to have the place to yourself. But overall I found the place to be very dark and in need of more attention.  Wish I could give a better review but have to be honest. ",Never met Mary or Jeff,-1

Unfortunately arriving late in the evening the neighborhood seemed a little sketchy and lots of cops were around which isn't always a great sign. But on the plus side the check-in was very simple, punched in the code and walked in, it was nice not having to worry about carrying a key around. 

Here are some pros and cons for this place:

Pros:
- close to downtown
- quiet neighborhood
- AC in room was great (it was 90+ during our stay)
- easy check-in/out
- TV/sound system/Roku
- comfortable beds

Cons:
- doesn't look like the best neighborhood but we didn't have any issues
- It was hot when we arrived
- windows have no screens, and one was left open so there were mosquitos and moths around the house... took a few hours to get rid of them!
- kitchen could be cleaner, the floor was sticky 
- same for the bathroom, it's a little run down
- no sheets underneath the comforters but they looked clean
- the bedroom light bulb was out

Just a few blocks from Pacific Place - where all the shopping is.  We basically walked everywhere, even to Pike Market - though it's an uphill climb back up to the apartment.  We had an 18month old with us, and the apartment was perfect in that he had plenty of space without worrying if he'd break anything or hurt himself.

I only have two issues, one is that the pictures are not exactly as advertised.  The layout of the apartment itself was slightly different. but they do give you an idea of what to expect.

The other is that we came to Seattle to watch the fireworks for NYE, and thought we'd have a view from the courtyard (as per the pictures).  Unfortunately, since there is a building being constructed across the street now, Metropolitan Towers no longer has a view of the Space Needle.  No worries though, the baby was sleeping anyway and we were able to catch the fireworks on TV.

We had no problems getting in and everything was as we expected (or better) from the online photos and reviews. We loved the apartment as it was large, clean, comfortable and had a complete kitchen. It is located on an oasis of sorts, with large 50-plus-year-old trees all around. (Rather unusual for a city location!) The trees, combined with cross ventilation and fans kept the apartment cool on a few very hot days. We easily found food supplies at the well-stocked QFC, a block away.  Also convenient, was bus transportation to the Space Needle on bus #8, one street over. From the apartment we could enjoy the street life without it being intrusive.

Also since I stayed for a while the new washer and dryer were perfect.

I also frequently ran in the nearby Green Lake Park - nice large park with tons of activities. There are restaurants, fastfood and supermarkets all within walking distance.

Susanna was very attentive and great in making sure everything is up to spec and even the little details like a fruit peeler is stocked in the kitchen (which I broke!) She even made sure my UPS packages are safe when they left it on the doorsteps. She is always reachable via text.

We liked it a lot and its really great if you like art, music and cool bars but its not for everyone as there is nothing else there. 
It is next to Boeing Field so there are loads of planes landing right over your head and also it is next to Highway 5 and several freight train lines.

I think there are some lovely rooms there with aircon but ours was very sparse with no furniture except a sofa and bed and a hanging rail. To be fair the airbnb description does convey the industrial feel.

Barbara is a bright and conscientious host; friendly and engaging, but completely respectful of privacy.  I enjoyed chatting with her.

The room is cozy and airy, with a comfortable bed.  I'm a light sleeper, but slept soundly here.

But the real delight is the back patio with koi pond.  The weather was fantastic during my stay, and it was the perfect place to eat breakfast, catch up on work, and read.  The sound of the waterfall also helped lull me to sleep at night.

The private entrance allowed me to feel completely comfortable coming and going as I pleased.

The location was great, too. The 16 bus is just a short walk away and is a 20 minute ride to downtown.  It's a quiet street, but just blocks away from lots of restaurants, shops, an historic cinema.

The suite was extremely clean and the soft carpet was perfect for my 8 month old daughter to crawl on.  They set up a pack n play and left toys for her to play, as well as plenty of brochures and magazines for us to find places to eat and visit throughout town. This led us to an AMAZING french bakery a few minutes from their house (Bakery Nouveau), as well as a wonderful kid's museum in Bellevue (KidQuest). Nathan was very quick to respond to our questions about the TV and wifi, which we used a lot and greatly appreciated.  Although not a huge disturbance, we could definitely hear the family upstairs, along with what seemed to be a little bit of construction during the day.  We'll definitely consider staying in the suite when we return to Seattle, especially if we visit with our daughter.

Pros: 
- Location was great, just a few short blocks from light rail. There was no need to rent a car. 
- House, room, and bathrooms were very clean. 
- Our room was large, but simple. It met our needs. Wi-fi access was good. 
- We loved the green features of the home. 
- Closet was a really good size (great for someone who plans on staying longer). 
- Access to the house was simple, the neighborhood felt safe and there were nice trails to run and walk on. We went on a long walk at Seaward Park and went for a run around the local golf course (they had a nice gravel trail around the course). There was also a farmer's (email hidden) hospital Saturday morning. 
- Great restaurants and live music a 10 minute walk away on Rainier ave. 
- The host and the other roommate were very polite. 

Other notes: 
- The room decor and furniture looked much different than the pictures, even though it was still a nice room. 
- The room was on the warm side at night, having an inexpensive fan  stored in the closet and available to help the air move would've been nice 

Overall, it was a great experience. I recommend this place to anyone looking to explore Columbia City or looking to take advantage of public transit to tour Seattle. Thank you for your hospitality.

13384,1136984,11526137,2014-04-06,7073824,Jess,"My girlfriend and I stayed at Sanjaya's place for two nights. We didn't get a chance to actually meet Sanjaya, but his assistant, Rick, was very friendly and helpful. Here's a list of the pros and cons:

Pros:
-Super convenient. We could walk everywhere we wanted to go.
-Quiet building, probably only saw five other residents during our whole stay.
-Amenities (TV, cable, fast wifi)
-Comfortable bed!

Cons:
-Parking. This was our biggest struggle. I tried to contact Sanjaya about where we could park, but he never got back to me about it. We ended up having to do street parking ($4/hr, pretty steep) until 6PM (when parking is free) and garage ($17 for 8 hours until 6PM when we relocated to street). However, this took a lot of planning around our day on when to move our car for it to be the most cost efficient. I saw on Sanjaya's reviews that he gave out parking passes to another guest, but this was not the case for us.
-Cleanliness of the space. The previous people left behind some food in containers in the fridge that looked like it had been sitting there for a while. That was a little nasty. Also, the area looked like it had not been dusted in months. There was thick dust on some of the furniture.
-Too expensive for the worth... mostly because of the parking costs. We could've stayed at the Best Western for $22 more a night, which would've included parking. We easily paid $40 in parking during our stay at Sanjaya's.

All in all, if you're planning on driving, be ready to spend a good amount of money on parking. If you don't have a car, it's perfect! ",We couldve stayed at the Best Western for 22 more a night which wouldve included parking,0

They picked me up at the airport and quickly answered any questions I had. The apartment was better than expected. It was clean and comfortable. The kitchen was well stocked. The view from the apartment is very nice to come home to. I was in town for a conference at the Washington State Convention Center. The walk took about 10-12 minutes through a nice neighborhood. I always felt safe walking through the neighborhood (Melrose to Pike). I would recommend The Pine Box for food and drinks (Melrose and Pine). I agree with other reviewers that the traffic noise from I-5 is palpable, but the bedroom is quiet. The traffic noise certainly did not keep me from enjoying a drink on the balcony in the evening and is typical of city life.

The donut shop next door is excellent and the neighbors are remarkably quiet.  As others have mentioned you can walk to anything you'd need from this location.  A word of warning if you have a car -  we were able to find street parking pretty easily plus there are several garages near the apartment but be forewarned that parking in Seattle is pretty pricey ($2.50/hour from 8 am - 8 pm).

It was the perfect place to do both and within easy walking distance of Capitol Hill for all our restaurant, bar and shopping needs! Other local (10 minute walk) restaurants and bars were easily accessible and recommended highly by Abil.

The room itself was adorable - plenty of closet and drawer space for two. We had water in our room ready on arrival and a lovely tour from Melissa. Every morning, a beautiful breakfast of fruit, coffee/tea and baked goods were served. When I had work early (this was every morning for a week!!!) Melissa and Abil packed some fruit to take to work with cute notes that brightened my day. They even saved me a baked good every day for when I came home.

In this brand new city I had the daunting task of finding an apartment in 4 days. From the moment Flor came out to help us carry our luggage up into our rooms, she made us feel as we had arrived at home with such a warm welcome. We had the choice to stay in many of her immaculate rooms which were well equipped with anything you might need on a short or even extended stay. Her location is right in the center of it all and is only 15 minuties to downtown Seattle. She is so close to parks and trails for running/hiking/biking, and walking distance to all sorts of grocery/merchandise stores. Her years of experience as a nurse really shines through as she has taken the time and thought to make sure you have everything you need for such an enjoyable visit. Our room had a spacious closet, orthopedic mattresses, desk, refrigerator, microwave, and even utensils to prepare our own dinner.  She supplied each of us with our own beautiful towel set, and the bathrooms were well stocked with luxurious shampoos and beauty products, so I wasn't in despair when I had realized I left a few things at home. The mornings were my favorite part of the stay, as we would wake up to the fragrant aroma of Flor's Peruvian cuisine coming from the kitchen. She had such an amazing selection every morning that started with hot peruvian coffee and fresh tropical fruit juices. My favorite was the hot peruvian omelets loaded with peppers, onions, mushrooms, spinach, avocados, and cheese served with the tasty mountain potatoes garnished with peruvian spices. Her home caters to every type of person/group. Whether you want a guide to the Seattle area, or if you just want your own private space to stay Flor truly allows you to decide what you like. She has grown to be one of my first and most genuine friends in this city. Two weeks after my first stay, I was in quite a difficult situation because I was unable to move into my apartment and started work in a few days. Without a place to stay or even a car to use, Flor immediately took me back into her beautiful home. She helped drive me around and took me shopping at Northgate mall (7min) and made sure that I was beyond prepared to start my new job with Boeing. In the meantime she allowed me to attend a party she was hosting where I was able to enjoy even more of the Peruvian cuisine and have a spectacular evening meeting her family. She truly is a genuine and amazing woman and has become like a mother to me. Whether laughing and learning to salsa dance together or even sharing memories from back home over dinner, there is such a heartfelt experience involved with staying at Flor's Place ""The 5-Star House.""",In this brand new city I had the daunting task of finding an apartment in 4 days,1

The accommodations are quite adequate for six adults–-the air mattresses are more like beds than air mattresses.  We could have used another (third)  bathroom but we made do with the two available facilities.  The many steps, at first, were daunting; by the end of the visit we’d become used to them.
Our hosts provided a fine array of dishes, utensils and cooking equipment,  but only French press coffee pots (which are inconvenient for making breakfast coffee for so many people).  We  borrowed an automatic drip pot.
The gas grill cooks Northwest salmon very well.  The kitchen stove is a bit scary.
Some of us missed having a TV and a telephone land line; some of us did not.
Our hosts are generous with provisions and with sharing much of what they have, including food in the fridge and the cupboards.  
The maintenance woman, whom we encountered incidentally, was kind and helpful.  Even though our hosts left us thorough,  written instructions  it helped to communicate with a live person.
All of our guests were pleasantly surprised at the accommodations; they thoroughly enjoyed being there.
The view of the sunsets is  awesome; the front and back yard landscaping are very well maintained.

The room feels completely separated from the main living areas in the house which gives it a fantastically quiet  and private experience. Everything was clean and tidy. Ruben and Chad were so very welcoming and sweet. They made our stay feel very warm as if we were staying with very close friends. At one point I pointed out something in the house I really liked (a food sign) and by the end of the day Ruben got me one from the market. So very sweet! The house is at the best location in town - a quiet part of Capitol Hill. We walked everywhere and felt so close to home. Bottom line - great experience and I highly recommend this fantastically charming room in Capitol Hill.,The stay with Chad and Ruben was outstanding,1

The cottage was newly remodeled with beautiful granite cabinets, fresh white cabinets, wood laminate floors, marble shower and bath floor.  It’s exceptionally clean and is nicely decorated.  Plenty of closet and drawer space for our “longish” stay.  Equipped with everything you need for dining (dishes, tableware, cookware, stove/oven, microwave oven, utensils, etc.).  There’s even a gas grill on the fenced patio.  Diane provided many little things that you need (but often forget) when staying in a unit with kitchen and laundry.  She included: Keurig style coffees, tea, sugar, butter, condiments (Ketchup, Mustard, Mayo, etc.), spices, etc.  Laundry soap and dryer sheets were also included.  The nicely appointed unit is essentially a great room with a separate bath/laundry room.  A parking space, WiFi and DirecTV are provided.  The cottage is located in a wonderful neighborhood at the top of Queen Anne’s hill. We enjoyed several neighborhood walks and enjoyed the many “stairs” in Queen Anne (Diane provided a map of all the stair locations.)  Don’t miss the incredible Seattle skyline/harbor view from Kerry Park. We also enjoyed several nearby restaurants (5 Spot, Betty’s, Hilltop Ale house) and shopped for groceries at the nearby Trader Joe’s and Safeway.  We really enjoyed staying in the friendly and quaint Upper Queen Anne neighborhood.  It’s just minutes to the harbor, downtown, the space needle, Pikes market and access to I-5.

I am new to Seattle and I ended up arriving a week earlier than planned. I was scrambling to find a decent place at the last minute and I'm so glad I found Daisy's place! This was my first Airbnb experience, so I was a little concerned about living in a stranger's home, but Daisy made me feel comfortable immediately. 

She's a decaf drinker, but prepared caffeinated coffee for my arrival (so considerate!). And on a rainy/windy Saturday when we both didn't want to leave the house, she shared her pizza with me. She's really friendly and easy to talk to as well, but not intrusive at all. I felt like I was living with one of my girl friends. 

The room is EXACTLY like the photos. Everything was clean and the bed was super comfortable. It was nice to have the TV and Roku. I didn't think I'd use it at first, but I definitely did. 

The neighborhood isn't the nicest neighborhood (never felt unsafe though), but it's very diverse and I found some great food nearby. The pho in Seattle is awesome. I'd recommend Pho Bac. I also found pretty good gyros at Mawadda Cafe on Graham st. Cheap eats! And if you're a sports nut like myself, Rookies is a great sports bar. Definitely go on Wing Wed (also all day happy hour on wed) and get the Garlic Parm wings!

Daisy's house is really close to the airport, which was convenient. I was surprised at how quickly I arrived. Also, street parking is abundant and the building has its own lot, which is where I kept my car. I would recommend having a car if you're going to be in this area.

Being new to this city, I was worried about a lot of things, but Daisy was so warm and friendly and helped put my mind at ease. I definitely got my transition to Seattle off on the right foot. =)",Cheap eats And if youre a sports nut like myself Rookies is a great sports bar,1

There was also plenty of room for an active three year old to fill in his time in the limited time we spent there.  We were pretty much gone from early in the morning to late evening, but what was wonderful and I guess I had not examined the property enough to see this, was that there are actually three rooms, so we had my son sleep on the futon in the room that has the front door.  Then there there is another sitting room that adjoins the kitchen and bathroom and off the sitting room is the bedroom.

The price was great. The room was nice and clean and the exposed brick In the 120+ y/o building was cool. 

The staff at merchants cafe were friendly and helpful.

This location is in the middle of a busy neighborhood and it will be loud at night. We were aware of this and were OK with it. If you are a light sleeper or easily annoyed by a car horn or drunken argument you have been forewarn.

The neighborhood is trendy with lots of restaurants,cafés, bars,galleries but also a neighborhood where you'll find homeless on the streets and pan handlers. Again this did not bother us. It's an issue in every city.

The only issue we had was with the WiFi not working.  We contacted Darcy and she had a staff member bring up a booster for the signal but that did not work either. She offered us a drink down stairs while we used the WiFi in the bar. While it was a very nice gesture and not having the internet in our room didn't ruin our weekend in was  disappointing.

During our stay we traveled by bicycle and access to the Burke-Gilman bike trail was only 2 blocks away. If you prefer travel by bus, the bus stop is even closer at just 1 block away. They were very accommodating and allowed access to their garage to store our rental bikes. We never felt uncomfortable coming and going from the house. I loved the fact that the entry points were by number access, this saved us any trouble of losing keys.

The house was fully renovated with very high end materials and the bathroom is TO DIE FOR. Simply gorgeous and very high end.  My fiance and I were discussing copying their design!  I miss the rain shower head.  There are 3 bathrooms and there was never an issue of access. 

Kay and Dennis always had great suggestions as far as navigating the city by bicycle and suggesting places to see along the way to our destination.  They were very friendly and respectable hosts.

Fremont also has some very very very good restaurants within walking distance of Kay's home. Paseo (get the cuban press or carribean sandwich) Best sandwich I've had, craving for it right now. But you can find anything from asian, mexican, italian, to american.

Coming from Florida, where we live in A/C 365 days a year, it was unexpected to find out that most homes and restaurants in the Northwest Pacific do not have a/c. It probably didn't help that we also arrived on one of Seattle's HOTTEST week this year, so the first night took some acclimating. The bedroom is on the subfloor which helps keep things cooler, however there are no windows in the bedroom so we had to rely on a fan to keep cool. Any other week and it probably would have been perfect, but we managed.

Overall, I can highly recommend staying with Kay and Dennis.  For the price, location, and 5-star bathroom its a win-win situation.

Errin's mini home is hands down the best place I have ever stayed. It's surprisingly roomy and Errin has seemingly anticipated every need her guests could have as the place is fully stocked with all the details that really do transform the space into a home away from home.

We were probably at our worst in terms of being guests since we were getting married that weekend. Since neither of us live in Seattle any longer, this wound up being home-base. Errin was patient, helpful and generally awesome. The porch outside served as a roomy place for our bridesmaids to get ready. After the wedding when we had a million gift wrappings, empty orange juice bottles - Errin's awesome partner was helping to sort it out for recycling.

We also got to work with Errin as the caterer for our wedding and holy moly - everything she touches is golden. We owe so much to her for our wedding being pulled off seamlessly.

62237,366301,42904960,2015-08-16,15699296,Louesa,"Dawn's apartment was the perfect spot for our two night trip to Seattle. It was well kept, peaceful and relaxing and we both appreciated her artistic and unique style. The apartment was spacious and comfortable and would be a great home base for anyone exploring the city.  The building itself is a great heritage building so it can be expected that the water pressure in the shower was a little weak and the floors creak a bit here and there, but we thought it was charming. 

We were in town to go to a Seahawks game and it was so easy to walk to the light rail station and ride just a few stops to the stadium (and just a couple more to downtown). 

Beacon Hill itself was a nice little neighbourhood with a couple of restaurants/bars, a grocery story and Jefferson Park (just across the street!) which had great views of the city. 

Dawn's friend Sarah was a great host: clear communication, great recommendations and very welcoming. 

We would not hesitate to go back to Dawn's place and give it a high recommendation. That said, if you are a light sleeper it is important to note that it is close to the trains and also under a flight path, so there is some ongoing noise, but some earplugs would probably take care of that. We weren't bothered.

37794,3951768,39927426,2015-07-27,33240337,Haley,"Let me start by saying I don't want to knock Kelly or her home and I respect anyone who is willing to open their home to complete strangers. I do, however, want to ensure that I am accurate in describing our personal experience.  

The area itself was big enough but it was not completely private. Once down the narrow dark stairway, you enter a utility area which includes the furnace, hot water tank, and laundry area. None of this is shown in the pictures. We had to use the flashlight on our phone to navigate our way through the pitch black until we could find a light around the corner. There was a note that indicated the owners wouldn't come down except to do laundry. Again, this wasn't mentioned in the ad. They never actually came down but we spent the 4 nights on edge that they might appear without warning. This was especially uncomfortable as the laundry is directly next to the bathroom. 
 
 The parking situation was probably the most frustrating. There was room in front of the house for 2 cars as well as a large enough driveway. Unfortunately someone purposely parked their vehicle across both spots on the road. We also weren't permitted to park in the driveway (which remained empty for almost the entire 4 days). Because of this we were forced to park down the street in a questionable neighborhood. 

  The neighborhood itself wasn't the worst place ever but it was definitely sketchy. The first sign of this was when I almost stepped on a used condom directly in front of the house. The funny thing about a used condom is nobody is going to clean it up so it remained there for the entire 4 days. This is obviously out of Kelly's control but again I'm just being honest. Very close to the I-5 and you could get almost anywhere in Seattle within 10-20 minutes. Also, an Uber cab was only $10 to downtown. We did avoid public transit because we felt it could be a little sketchy at night. 

Kelly and her roommate were quick to respond to our texts. Other than that there was no direct interaction with either of them which was fine by us. 

On a positive note, the bed was decently comfortable, the shower was great and as mentioned, the proximity to downtown was great. Also, when you consider most hotels downtown are around $300 a night in summer, you're getting a great deal at $80.

Kevin's place was perfect.  Just right for me with a well-stocked kitchen (I prefer to cook my own food rather than eat out all the time), washer and dryer (so I didn't need to bring too many clothes with me), great wifi (so I could work from the apartment if I wanted to), clean and quiet to help me get over my jet lag (I came in from France).  This was not an issue for me, but as someone else mentioned, there are a lot of rather steep stairs, so if you are uncomfortable with steep stairs, it might be difficult for you.
Kevin answered all my questions very quickly - but I did not have many since everything was very well organized.  There is a nice view from the apartment and you can walk to a bakery and small supermarket nearby.  There is also a bus stop up the street ($2.50 or $2.75 depending on time of day - make sure you have change) with a bus that goes directly downtown.  I had a rental car (easy to park out front or in the back), but I was able to walk a lot, take the bus (easy) and Uber a few times.  I also found a great fish restaurant that I would recommend (a bit of a walk from the apartment but I did it) called Five Hooks on Queen Anne Avenue North - a kind of casual, friendly seafood restaurant (moderately priced) with wonderful fresh oysters and fish.

 I recalled the building from a prior trip to Seattle last year. The building is approx 1.5 years old and is 93% occupied.  The walk score is accurate and the Pike Market is 4 blocks away.  The unit was in excellent shape.  The roof deck was outstanding with a beautiful view of the Bay.  Two grills were available and a gas fire pit was going to be installed in the coming days. 

The bedroom had a very comfortable bed and there were two large closets on either side of the bed. What was lacking was a chest of drawers  and sufficient hangers. Eve did take the feedback on the chest drawer concern.  Additionally I would point out that the unit lacked AC.. .not a big deal in Seattle accept when the temps get into the 70's which it  did while we were there for 9 nights. We went to the Target and purchased a fan which we left for whomever comes behind us.
 
The unit had an excellent large screen flat panel TV, wifi Internet but lacked  cable service. Local channels were marginally received with the rabbit ear antennae. I would suggest that one carries an HDMI cable or Chromecast ( or other media ) to jack into the TV if you want to use your laptop. Also there was a Netflix account on the TV.

The only downside to the unit was the street noise and the street people located around the building. Restaurants and bars contributed to excessive noise  as did the rantings of street people. Traffic noise was somewhat constant that could be mitigated by closing the unit up ...but then you had to deal with the heat buildup in the unit.

There's nothing missing in this house. There were 5 of us and so the owners set up an extra bed in the basement. Didn't know what to expect, but even the basement is really nice with a top of the line queen-sized air bed, plenty of room and it's own bathroom, complete with shower! The master suite is amazing, especially the spa tub. I cannot say enough about how nice and well appointed and well kept this entire house is. They have thought of everything. We had a rental car, but also used the nearby bus service once, and that was a great way to get to the Seattle Center or downtown. The views of the city at night will keep you out on the deck or the terrace, and the neighborhood is quiet but friendly.

Serina is truly awesome - so flexible and really communicative and generous!

Knowing that I was arriving before the official check-in time, he encouraged me to head to the house straight from the airport and relax in the common area until the Suite was ready - when I arrived, the Suite was ready for me early (clean and well-stocked with toiletries, maps/tourist information, snacks, and extra linens/blankets), which was a wonderful welcome after a long trip from the East coast.

The Suite (especially the amazing bathroom) surpassed my expectations based on the listing, and the neighborhood was convenient for public transportation, walking to restaurants, shopping for groceries, and access to local parks.  Walking alone at night, I felt quite safe there.  Having access to the basement washer & dryer, was also a huge plus.  

Tom was extremely hospitable whenever our paths crossed during the 4 days/nights I was there, and encouraged me to make myself at home in his house, which was easy to do.  I was staying in Seattle in advance of my goddaughter's wedding outside the city, which was the following weekend at Cama Beach State Park.  With regard to our various wedding preparations, Tom was extremely generous and flexible:  my goddaughter's younger sister ended up staying with me in the Suite and Tom graciously welcomed her; and he allowed us to pack his basement refrigerator with lots of groceries we bought for the wedding weekend.  Over and above his role as Airbnb host, he was a huge help in our wedding preparations.

There was minimal street noise and the building was *very* quiet.

I just can't get over it - the decor, the garden, each room and bathroom were beautiful with extra linens, soaps and shampoos; the outdoors were just as enticing.

47344,4783585,50428490,2015-10-12,8400796,Lindsay,"The apartment is located in a really great area of the Belltown neighborhood in Seattle. The secure garage parking space that is included with the rental is an incredible amenity for a downtown Seattle rental. The apartment had everything that we needed for our five-day stay and the host supplied a starter kit of basic necessities that included toilet paper, paper towel, soaps, etc. The apartment was very clean, easy to access, and the main living spaces were very comfortably laid out. There was an ironing board, iron, and clothes steamer, which all came in very handy during our stay!

The only concern that we had was the size of the 2nd bedroom. We understood that the 2nd bedroom didn't have a closet, but we weren't aware that the room was so tiny that while sitting on the bed a person could easily reach and touch all four walls. There was only room for one nightstand in the room, which was located on one side of the king bed. We had to turn sideways and sidestep around the bed to get in and out of the room. 

The 2nd bedroom also didn't have a closet, which we knew before we secured the rental. But this meant that we had to hang clothes on the curtain rod that is located above the sliding balcony door in the room. Hanging clothes on the curtain rod led to additional difficulty maneuvering around the bed, as we had to duck down under the hanging clothes. We would suggest that a smaller bed be put in the 2nd bedroom so that a person could stand next to the bed to get dressed and not have to monopolize the one bathroom while getting dressed. Creating slightly more space in the 2nd bedroom would make it more convenient for two people to use the room, especially if a 2nd nightstand could be added. A 2nd nightstand would help for storage of toiletries, cell phones, etc. 

The lack of a closet in the 2nd bedroom and constrained space of the room forced us to leave all of our toiletries, cell phones, clothes, jackets, and shoes out in the living room. This worked for us because we only had four people staying at the apartment. However, the apartment is advertised to accommodate up to six people. We really don't know how the apartment could accommodate six people (and any luggage) for more than a day or two. 

All of this being said, we had an excellent trip, the cleanliness of the apartment, the ease of check-in and check-out, and all of the amenities that were included made the trip very enjoyable.

Looking through everything availible, I came across Jill &Jerome's "" quaint apt"" and realized it was perfect for us. I sent the message out to book, and Jill responded within a few short hours. She made sure to keep an open line of communication from beginning, with the booking and all the way thru to the morning we left. Once Shana and I arrived in the city, Jill let us know she wouldn't be home at the time of our arrival but be back at a later point if we needed anything. As per the directions we were given, we entered the apartment and were shocked.  Jill & Jerome made sure to have anything you would think to need while traveling. There was an overwhelming sense of home and that is hard to come by, let alone try to fake. The location of the apartment is in perfect walking distance from a slice of Historic Colombia City. It holds a little bit of everything from the restaurants, to a great art house theater. It makes exploring worth it. Shana and I had a chance to speak to Jill, and found out that it was their first experience being a host on AirBnB. I was amazed to hear it because she seemed to be a season pro, and that earns double the thumbs up from me.

We we shown around the apartment and given a few tips on places to go and things to see. On the day of our arrival there was another guest checking out and so they had arranged to leave their bags in the apartment to come and collect them later on which is pretty usual practise with most airbnb listings. We went and explored the city that day and on arriving back later on realised that someone had rifled through our possessions. Nothing had been taken but even so we found this completely inappropriate and totally violating. Not only that but later on that evening at approx 11.30pm another guest was checked in by another friend of the host. She decided to show this guest around pretty much shouting around the apartment waking us both up after what had been a 15 hour flight getting there and a long day in the city. I contacted the host the next day to explain what had happened and he seemed very apologetic yet when I messaged him again to give him the full details he didn't reply.

3.And how nice was it, on a cool rainy night, to find a corkscrew in the fully equipped kitchen to enjoy a bottle of wine, while watching a movie from the DVD library, in front of a nice warm fire in the fireplace!!!

The foldout couch in the living room was badly stained, very old, and had some kind of debris on it, and was unsuitable for sleeping (our stay was prior to his warning about the couch on his listing).  The building that the apartment is in was very musty and in bad repair, and the apartment was two floors down, which is rather inconvenient if you have luggage.

Serina was helpful and gracious and had clearly thought through all the details, so we really didn't have any problems.  We weren't surprised at all when we got to the apartment and looked around; it really is just as presented here.

It's extremely convenient if you're doing anything at Seattle Center (Space Needle, Chihuly Gardens and Glass, EMP, etc.)  We didn't mind the walk to Pike Place Market and there were a number of restaurants and convenience stores along the way in the Belltown neighborhood.  The free bus (Route 99) is a few minutes walk and can get you to the waterfront, Pike Place Market and Pioneer Square even quicker.

From the airport, we took light rail to Westlake Center, then got on the monorail to Seattle Center.  From there, it was about a ten-minute walk to the apartment.  Total cost: $5 per person!",Even though its a onebedroom apartment and smaller than our home we never felt cramped,0

Before we had arrived I thought that things were much farther apart, but I was surprised to see how close we were to everything! We had rented a car so it was a very easy trip to get to downtown, the zoo, the locks, and other restaurants in different neighborhoods. The parking spot is a little tricky with a pole and 2 cars that never seemed to be gone, but thankfully they put some padding around the pole that protected our car! We had a Ford Edge and I wouldn't recommend bringing anything much bigger here. 
Since this is right off Aurora/99 and almost to the Fremont Bridge, there isn't much to walk to around the neighborhood (with kids anyway), but that didn't bother us. 
Timothy and Brittney were great hosts!! They answered questions promptly and were very helpful. They provided us with a pack n play, high chair, and baby bath so we didn't have to rent them and my kids were so excited to see coloring books, sticker books, and bubbles!! Very thoughtful. They also put up a light blocking curtain over the patio door when they knew the blinds wouldn't be installed in time. 
The apartment itself was very clean and both beds were comfortable. It was very nice to be able to do laundry mid trip with kids and be able to cook breakfast every morning.

It was nice to feel like you had your own space while visiting Seattle. I love the chalkboard in the hallway with stuff that people have written. Also, Gil and Tom were very responsive to our questions.

The location is perfect, especially if you like to immerse yourself in a neighborhood, instead of around all the tourists. During our stay, we were able to walk around to a number of great establishments. Every morning, I would make sure to grab coffee and breakfast at Katy's Corner Cafe. Also, Skillet Diner, which was suggested by Gil and Tom, is absolutely out of this world. The people are great and the food is even better. We ended up going to this place a few times. There is also a local beer spot for hanging out. 

Transportation to all the sights is easy as well. The 2 bus is located on Union Ave and we were able to get to where we wanted to go. 10 minutes to Downtown Seattle.

It was only a block or two to get to public transportation (Bus 99 goes to Pike and the Needle) and you're minutes (walking) from the football and baseball stadiums, Cherry Coffee and Elysian Brewing Co.

The hosts were great! They had fruit, snacks and drinks waiting for us when we arrived. They even went so far as to have Belgian waffle mix and syrup ready so that we could use the Belgian waffle maker. 

The bathroom had a locking door for the toilet and the shower had a privacy curtain so it was easy to share with other people. I also loved that your could decorate the walls with chalk! Oh, and they had plenty of emergency toiletries and supplies in case you were in a jam.

As for the sleeping arrangements, between the sofa bed, queen air mattress and really comfy (and huge) couch, there was plenty of room to spread out.

1. This is not a review for Sunny 3BDhome, but rather ""Fantastic View"", Qing's other property. That is because the day before we were to check in, we were given the address to ""Fantastic View"". When I pointed out the mistake, Qing informed us he had moved us due to repairs, acted like he was doing us a favor and asked if we wanted to cancel. We really had no other choice but to accept even though it was another part of the city.
2. On the last night we were staying there, we came home at 2am. We were listening to music and talking. It wasn't party music but it was likely too loud for 2am. Definitely our fault. The person who lives there normally, was staying below. She came to our door and yelled at us at around 2:20am. We immediately turned off the music, apologized profusely and went to bed. Dead silence in the house. At 4am, we received a text message from the caretaker demanded we immediately leave her house (not Qing's so don't know what's going on there). We explained it was 4am and had nowhere to go and once again apologized. She again demanded we leave, contacted Airbnb, threatened to call the police and generally acted unstable. We agreed to exit but needed to get our things in order and finally left around 7:20am. During that time she came into the apartment and was unhinged (on video) screaming at us (broken English). We were polite during this entire crazy middle of the night escapade.
3. After checking out, later that day, we got a demand for $420 damage we had done. Pictures were provided by the host as proof of damage. What the pictures show is the cheap plastic bar lock for the sliding door leading to the patio. During our stay we had gone out onto the patio. This bar lock had a screw that fell out as we tried to unlock it, or remove it to go out onto the patio (a bar lock prevents people coming in from outside). It fell out because it was cheap and well worn. If we had a screwdriver we could have fixed it. If the host has a screwdriver they could fix it. Instead, in an act of retribution for 15-20 of loud music that was politely and immediately shut off, Qing has attempted to extort us for $420. That is unresolved but I hope Airbnb does the right thing.

This apparently is an ongoing problem. We were advised to keep all food in fridge or plastic bags. We felt it necessary to wash everything in the kitchen before using it.

Small, low power microwave. Tea kettle and French press, but no coffee maker. Although described as a ""fully equipped"" kitchen, few pots and pans, and most of those in really bad shape (heavy burned on crust in one pan, for example).

No air conditioning + no screens on windows = mosquitoes. Not enough fans for each bedroom.

Exposed wiring and fire hazards. Wires taped together with electrical tape. Hard to find light switches. Fan missing grille, so blades exposed. Holes in walls, rotten / broken woodwork, bathtub disintegrating.

Street parking very difficult during business hours. Didn't tell us about parking issues until the day before we arrived. Some of us had to pay to park.

Only house on block, in between tall concrete walls in industrial neighborhood. 

Two wash cloths for four people to share. No kitchen linens. When we asked for wash cloths and kitchen linens, got brief answers on text messages that basically said 'sorry"" and use paper towels. But then the next day, he dropped off washcloths and linens and mentioned ""I just got back in town."" Why didn't he just tell us he was out of town and would bring something the next day? We went out and bought some.

Asked us to check out early - apparently based on other reviews, that's a pattern. Asked if it would be okay for his band to practice in the basement, but when we requested quiet, he replied no problem.

Odd seating in living room (one full size futon, one easy chair, two office chairs, a padded bench). Not enough chairs in kitchen. Odd assortment of chairs, one very rickety. Downstairs bedroom has one standard twin bed and another that is very high--would need a small stepstool to get into it. One upstairs bedroom has two twins. The other has a full bed with a nice mattress and a twin bed. 

This is clearly a ""party house."" Overall, this place would be best for a group of friends not planning on doing much cooking and not concerned with cleanliness. Definitely not suitable for children.

This condo is nestled by Capitol Hill and very close to restaurants and even a few convenient stores.  It is an easy walk down to Pike's Place (about 15-20 min walk) and all the other tourist spots.  The little touches in her apartment make your stay more comfortable, from the toiletries to the coffee maker.  Connie was also very responsive if we had a question about something and even accommodated our request to stay an additional day.  I would definitely stay here again.",Connies apartment was exactly as pictured,1

This location appeared to be a perfect fit. And it was.

Our stay at Queen Anne between 2-4 Aug was everything we had hoped for. We all felt at HOME. The 3 queen-sized beds we all found very comfortable, and even though there is only one main bathroom, this was not a problem with careful scheduling between the 5 of us. Overall this home has a very nice feel from top to bottom.

Marian is a terrific hostess, immediately making us feel at home and making sure any questions were answered. The pictures are accurate, the place is really cute and very clean. We absolutely loved the Garage Door open - and there is privacy with the Bamboo they have growing right outside the door. Kitchen is wonderful - stocked with all one would need (and a dishwasher!). 
We were there with our adult son who slept on the sofa bed in the living room and we thought there was plenty of room. The bathroom is a very good size, not small at all. The bedroom is wonderful - great bed! If you have a car, they have even given us the driveway to park in.  This is great for loading/unloading and we always have a parking spot. We noticed that the street parking gets tight.
We'll be back in Seattle and this is where we look forward to staying again.  Honestly, this could not be a nicer place to stay - but the icing on the cake is Marian! She made us feel so welcome.
Last thing I'll mention is that Trader Joe's only has 3 locations in the Seattle area and one of these is only about a mile from here. Huge plus!!

Two choices at night: windows closed to get rid of street noise but bake, or windows open and hear all the traffic.  Most of the time, I'm sure it isn't a problem, particularly in Seattle..

So many dining and bar choices nearby, the beds were comfy, the place was finely stocked, and check-in straightforward. And much less cost than a hotel.

We walked to the Space Needle, Pike Place Market, and the waterfront.  Did I mention it's a great location?  It is Belltown, so there are panhandlers and homeless folks wandering around at night, but like everywhere they're more a nuisance with begging than anything else.

She is beyond a host who just provides you a place to stay, but also a sweet, considerate, thoughtful, warm and close friend. She made dinner and invited me to join with her friend the day I arrived.  She made very good French press coffee for me every morning. She gave me tons of advices of where to explore the city and how. And during my last night stay, she made popcorns and we watched Lilyhammer together. I felt like at home and really enjoyed my time stayed there. Her lovely pets Lambda(dog) and Haskell(cat) are both very smart and sweet companions.

The place located at a perfect spot of the city——Capitol Hill, which is walkable to everywhere. I did not take any transportations everyday I started my trip.  My room was clean, neat and comfortable. The bed is soft and big. You can find anything in hotel such as towel, soap, water in your room and even maps. The neighborhood is clean and quite too.

The host forgot that I had made early check-in arrangements. The house was filthy.

The house smells, the upper master bedroom especially. We couldn't find the source of the smell, but I've had to wash all our clothes and take things to the dry cleaners to remove the stale, almost rotten smell, from our clothing.
